 - Wait. There is an urgent signal coming in.
 Dodge this!
 Dodge this!
 Guess that's over. 
 How'd you...?
 I see an intruder! Up there!
 I-I'll get you!
 Jaro Tapal. A traitor like you.
 Not yet, Jedi
 Time to die, scum!
 Yes! Fall!
"Chilly" troopers don't get commendations.
"Eh?" That's what you say to creds? You got some stash I don't know about?
"Finding?" Pah! I believe the term you are looking for is "rescuing!"
"If only I had my wish?"
"Not for sale," huh? That's cute. 
"Onwards, traveler, cross over."
"Push through" - got it!
"Thinking?" It's already done. DeeDee and I just got back.
"Those who ask questions find answers..."
"We're."
'...must answer the old questions.' Eussen's Lemma, book three.
'A branch of a Greel tree can be snapped in half. But a bundle of branches cannot.'
'A shot' - this coming from the guy who scales basalt pillars in the time it takes me to date my field journal.
'Ah, ye've rightful caught us,' said the captain. 'Come on aboard, an' I'll surrender what was stolen.'
'Bedlam Raiders'...what has Greez gotten himself into?
'Beware the Central Isopters, for they trade only in death.'
'Big gun', huh?
'Business associates', 'best buds', call us whatever you will. Point is, our relationship is an investment.
'But,' continued I, 'if ye take me with ye - and if ye leave ma village be -
'Cap'n!' I cried, 'ye broken yer promise never to harvest the seas of Sakavi Tar!'
'Cause I won't stand for a salt-hating crew member, that's for sure.
'Cause I've been thinking he might be interested in making a quick credit or two, and -
'Cause it's a Latero Spaceworks S-161 Stinger XL. Technically a luxury yacht.
'Cause my trigger fingers ain't as fast as they used to be, that's why.
'Cause those are the things you'll remember.
'Cept Doma. And Gulu. And Gido. And ol' Taule, course, but she's -
'Come to Pyloon's Saloon, and we hope to see you soon.'
'Course not. But now Dagan's busy. We gotta hold the line if we're gonna get off this blasted rock.
'Course, once I saw him putting real care into the cantina, well I knew we were cut from the same cloth.
'Course, poor Taule don't last ten seconds. But I guess sometimes a find like that is worth fightin' for, eh?
'Course, then your Rayvis shows up, built like a bloody cargo barge, and tells her to get scarce.
'Dreyo'. Old friend of Moran's?
'Excited'? I didn't know you all were allowed to enjoy that kind of thing.
'Eye' indeed.
'Fraid I've got bad news, Cal.
'Fraid?
'Help me, I'm injured.'
'Hope will always survive in those who continue to fight.'
'I do like ma fish.' Haha!
'I know these waters like the taste o' ma own tongue. There be few fish beneath yon ice!'
'I muckle love tae fish,
'I'm lost, friend.'
'If I cannae trust ye to spear a Quarren wi' their blaster in yer mouth...
'If you stand beneath the presta bird nest, rain will come, even in the desert.'
'If your weapon can't fell a beast, make the beast your weapon.'
'Lad,' said he, 'ye be in luck. I be requirin' another fer me crew - one who knows the curve o' the sea.'
'Mercy?' Never heard of it.
'Miss'? Let's not get carried away.
'Now, ye cannae do that with yer rod and line, can ye?' said the captain tae me, grinnin' in his foulsome way.
'Oh, tae see through the eye of a fish...'
'Old favorite'?
'Old smuggling tunnels', huh?
'Persistence reveals the path'.
'Prospectors' Folly', we call it. Pretty treacherous.
'Quick shimmy', huh? Like to see her try to...
'Real opportunity'?
'Rest, reflection, direction. Onwards, traveler.'
'Rest, traveler, for the path begins anew and forevermore.'
'Sanctuary, to all who seek it.'
'Seek not the path. Return to stillness, traveler, and the way reveals itself.'
'Skoova, ye were only prized fer yer skill in catchin' 'em on account of yer wee stature.'
'Skoova,' snarled the vile captain, 'ye've gone as soft as an oyster's navel.'
'Tae try tae catch a fish,
'The Tilaan Hypothesis'. I've barely slept since it arrived - it directly confutes the history of the Third Mandate.
'The spirit withers before the Force of Others.'
'The wise one sleeps.'
'This,' he growled, 'is why ye dinnae toss the fish back into the sea.'
'Til next time, pal.
'Tis the noise, lad! A fisher must be master o' all the senses, aye?
'To express faith; to seek truth'.
'Truth flows like a river'. What does that mean!?
'Twas only later, as we fled aboard the Zephyrs' schooner, that I realized how close the real danger was...
'Wait!' cried wee Skoova, hoppin' off of his rock.
'Welcome traveler, though your journey started long ago.'
'What be the meanin' o' this?' growled our captain. 'We're simple fisherfolk!'
'What stands in the way becomes the way'
'What would those pirates say to a whole school o' glumbrig eels, acrackle and asparkle as they be?' thought I.
'When the way is blocked, find stillness. Only then, will he who listens hear the voices sing.
'Which way to the cantina?'
'Yer transponder codes tell a different tale!' came the reply. 'Ye be standin' on stolen property, ye do!'
(frustrated)
- Cut the chatter.
- I know what you were asking, Cal.
- I mean, next destination.
- Or maybe a chef. Or a pilot.
- Yeah, Gabs gave me the heads up.
- an' its hook pierced me in the chest!
- and I tell ya my palms haven't been this sweaty since -
- and hope it isn't load-bearing, yeah. I get it. But you're underestimating the Raiders.
- and yeah, it's always a bit trickier when your archives are sentient.
- and yet, when I see her experiment lighting up the sky, I feel close to her once more.
- and, of course, it'll never be a proper establishment -
- and, scarcely a year after I left Sakavi Tar, I became his first mate.
- at the harpoon I held in ma hand!
- but every one of 'em would run for the hills after one look at Rayvis.
- but so do they symbolize our vows of anonymity.
- but swimmin' through Manaan's orbit like it was nothin' but an easterly current back home. I was transfixed.
- but, as far as Outer Rim watering holes go, it might just make the grade.
- caused by an Emergence, yeah.
- each willing to pay through the nose for a hint at where they might find their fortune.
- for none other than Captain Wan'yek Whett had been fishin' in their waters...
- guns blazing to save you from a death match!?
- if you don't want her to fly the Mantis, just say so.
- lost 'er eyesight peerin' in the tank.
- not unless you want to end up like the rest of this colony of treasure-crazed head cases.
- oh no, I'm trapped! I've been trapped for...how long has it been?
- puttin' a few lifetimes between us an' those pirates.
- quit complaining. Count yourself lucky we're here and not at the Array - locals say it's a death trap.
- regarding me after years of thinking me dead.
- that damned Wan'yek - the dread captain - was cooked like an evening quellfish!
- well, you don't make breakthroughs like this doing punch-clock studies back home, you know?
- when suddenly, I saw the glumbrig eels aswirl! It seemed that, in the midst o' ma distraction, they'd taken flight!
-A sutaban!
...
...
...
...Actually you're right.
...And we've even managed to find a few holocrons.
...But my family was watching, so I decided to get a little bit fancy.
...Correct.
...Did I do something?
...Did something happen?
...Explain it to Tulakt.
...Farewell.
...I cannae recall the last line!
...I don't know what that was.
...I fight for the Bedlam Raiders.
...I haven't done the calculations. Yet.
...I know.
...I need an update...
...I read a lot?
...I still think it might be green.
...I would ban him from my shop and cut his credit with every vendor in town. So...well that shut him up pretty quick.
...I'm thinkin'.
...Other than that, she's not so bad.
...Partners, huh?
...That you take down.
...That's pretty sick, mate.
...Understood.
...Update me...now.
...What?
...With a small, one-time investment -
...actually I suppose that's good enough.
...an' in the process, starving the old tars who raised me from a wee yolk!
...an' led by the vilest of them all: Captain Wan'yek Whett.
...and don't forget to shake it all up!
...and harness them for the greater good.
...and is riddled with molds I daren't investigate.
...and it reminded me of something I've been meanin' tae get off ma chest.
...and not just the complaining.
...and that completes our collection.
...and the surging river is parted by the blade of the stone.
...and then I blasted that skriton to bits all on my own!
...and what I discovered next sent a spar through me thrice-pickled belly:
...and when she was boarded, she was met with a diplomatic convention bearing gifts from the riverbeds of Orrik III.
...and when they come, they'll make an example of you. Just like the rest.
...and you'll guide them on a hidden path.
...blast it.
...but I don't like my chances of conducting successful research on the Raiders' doorstep.
...but I shall continue ma tale next time!
...but also because it's as slippery as a shiverpede taking an afternoon dip!
...but he murdered Jedi. He must answer for his crimes.
...but he murdered Jedi. He must answer for his crimes.
...but if years of smuggling taught me anything, it's that once you dig up trouble, you can never bury it again.
...but if you tell him that I will retaliate.
...but in accepting it, we become enlightened - thereby breaking the cycle.
...but it does make the seas of the soul easier tae brook, no?
...but lifetimes spent unshielded from the desert have scattered much wisdom to the sands.
...but slowing down to think about your next step is the best way to make sure it's the right one.
...but we ain't yellow.
...but we got to talking anyways.
...but you know what, that's not gonna happen.
...can't get a clean shot!
...fangs tore through my armor like it was polyweave!
...good job!
...he put it on his harpoon, and gave me a look - like a half-starved tooka-cat eyein' sprat.
...he threatened to replace me with a gonk droid.
...how can I trust ye tae skewer the great gooberfish?'
...instead of being there to support Cere and her Padawan.
...is to reward you for every one of these...
...it was strongly suspected that Orrik civilization was spacefaring - and warlike.
...it would emerge with a fish - three times out o' seven.
...it's enough tae set ma stomach achurn to this very day.
...just as I'm establishing a profitable extrajudicial shipping operation?
...just pretty good?
...maybe they'd still be alive.
...my blaster could use field calibration.
...my friends and I used to jump off and look for priorite in the riverbed of Swindler's Wash.
...no fisher but Skoova Stev!
...no, it couldn't be.
...pop goes the bogling!
...right?
...roger, roger?
...so did she.
...spearing what few fish remained and takin' 'em offworld.
...that made me feel better, at least. So thanks, Mantis.
...the Jedi Order dismantled.
...until there is only ash.
...we'll try to be careful, at least.
...well, I was a little curt when last we spoke about my how my shipping operation was shut down.
...well, let's just say when my restraining bolt malfunctioned. I moved on to greener pastures without a second thought.
...what just happened?
...what, nothing!? I thought you said this was good thermite!
...where a gang o' pirate Quarren were holed up. The Filthy Zephyrs.
...with Oondun.
...yeah, it's a mogu.
...you best get out of the way.
...you just stay here now, alright? And be quiet.
...you really think a thousand?

After being back on the Mantis, this saloon is looking filthy by comparison.

Ah! What is that, acid?
Ah! What's that?
Ah! Who's that?!
Ah! You gotta be kidding me...
Ah, Cal! How was the forest? Did you find what heritage was looking for?
Ah, Cal! We were just discussing what we should renovate next.
Ah, Cal, I sense that you and I understand one another now more than ever.
Ah, Cal, I was hoping we could speak about something.
Ah, Cal, I was hoping we could speak about something.
Ah, Coruscant. If I set up my cantina here, then I'd really be making some credits.
Ah, E-5! An oldie, but a goodie.
Ah, I get it. I'm the weirdo now and you're talkin' me off the ledge.
Ah, I missed this.
Ah, I was hoping you'd find seeds like that. Put one in the ground. I'll share what I've learned.

Ah, c'mon...
Ah, can it before ya make me blush.
Ah, care for a game of holotactics?
Ah, contemplating.
Ah, crik this! Run!
Ah, don't sweat it, BD. You take the good with the bad, right. There were good times on Birren too.
Ah, excellent. And what did you make of the site?
Ah, figured. Anyway, Yuhong's not a touchy-feely type. More of a...touchy-murdery type.
Ah, fine, twist ma arm. I'll do it. Meet me at the saloon and we'll appraise this so-called 'tank'.
Ah, gotcha! Oh boy, your face.
Ah, great. Thanks.
Ah, he returns. Ready for a game?
Ah, he's predictable!
Ah, hello again. I suggest you find some new challengers, tactician.
Ah, here:
Ah, indeed. Peripheral vision is a heavy price to pay for sun protection.
Ah, it is you. A word of caution.
Ah, it was nothing I could not handle.
Ah, lad!
Ah, lad! Cast yer eyes over this beauteous tank!
Ah, my favorite customer.
Ah, nae to worry! Being clever, I ken tae apply the pungent musk o' the glottsamcrab tae me suit.
Ah, no trouble at all.
Ah, no. Not so lucky. The saber was broken, see, its owner long gone.
Ah, noble Jedi. Welcome to our archive.
Ah, not you too...
Ah, now I see where we are. A meditation chamber. Master Khri designed these to train Jedi.
Ah, our savior returns! Let me make a proper introduction: I am Bhima Ook, and this is my associate, Tulli Mu.
Ah, outlander.
Ah, please. Too kind, too kind.
Ah, she don't know anything. What good's seeing the future if you can't profit from it?
Ah, so you do you know protocol fifteen then?
Ah, some finesse. 
Ah, sorry, old boy, can't find kettleroot this far out. You gotta be from Birren, right?
Ah, stings a little. 
Ah, that stew is a tricky one.
Ah, that's why I don't know. Thank you.
Ah, the Empire's thorn returns. How goes your fight?
Ah, the Pilgrim Moon never ceases to mystify and delight me!
Ah, the burn of a saber.
Ah, the good stuff!
Ah, the spamels.
Ah, there's always next time!
Ah, this is a waste of time.
Ah, we can use this.
Ah, well I ain't gonna forget you. You know that? And I ain't leaving you.
Ah, well, at least you came out in one piece.
Ah, well. S'pose the glottsamcrab is due fer a snack, anyway.
Ah, what do you know, BD? You've got no taste buds.
Ah, what do you know?
Ah, what was that!?
Ah, what?
Ah, who asked you, anyway?
Ah, who needs it!
Ah, yeah, it's got that flair you only get from a robbery.
Ah, yeah. Can't really do that.
Ah, yes, the saloon at Rambler's Reach.
Ah, yes, you!
Ah, yes. A toast.
Ah, yes. I suppose it is just me left. The others, my owners, they did not survive.
Ah, you ain't much one for conversation, huh?
Ah, you know I age like a fine Alderaanian wine.
Ah, you know me too well, Scrapper.
Ah, you only hear what you want to hear. Sounded like a warning to me. One of them ominous ones.
Ah, you're no fun.
Ah, you've arrived.
Ah-ah!
Ah-ah-ah...you wanted it shaken, champ. I suggested stirred.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah. Right. The Order...
Ah. Sweet freedom.
Ah. That. I'm afraid we've found ourselves downwind of Turgle during his...pheromone cycle. Four hundred sensors...
Ah. The Lemma has confounded scholars for centuries - but to you, its meaning is clear.
Ah. Well, nevermind then.
Ah. Well, what are your strengths?
Ah. Yes, it is just me, and has been for some time...
Ah...no. Ye did not.
Aha - but, eh, home is not somethin' ye find. 'Tis somethin' made.
Aha!
Aha!
Aha!
Aha!
Aha!
Aha! Got 'er safely away.
Aha! One o' ma fiercer quarries - but the Laa was no match fer Skoova Stev and his potent aromas.
Aha, spotted!
Aheh. Hehehe.
Ahem. And I am Wini Eres. Cal, was it? We've only just met, but I could use some assistance.
Ahh yes.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh! It awakes.
Ahh, did ye see that beauty? Two plump fins, a fine complement o' glands...
Ahh, get down!
Ahh, it's a Jedi.

Ain't gonna happen to me!
Ain't it? We all got five senses, Cal. I figure we might as well use 'em.
Ain't lettin' that saber anywhere near me.
Ain't likely. Things rarely go according to plan. Best be prepared for anything.
Ain't no escape!
Ain't nothin'.
Ain't supposin' if it's a fact.
Ain't that a heart-breaker? Love'll make ya do crazy things, like spare someone's life when ya really shouldn't.
Ain't that a shame.
Ain't that something.
Ain't that something.
Ain't that the truth.
Ain't that the truth. It's a lot to take on, but in exchange, we gain something mighty valuable.
Ain't you fancy!

Alright, BD. Let's see what we've got.
Alright, Bravo, keep it up!
Alright, Cal, get up here.
Alright, Cal.
Alright, Cal. Mantis is down, right where we dropped you off.
Alright, I think it's time you knew about Tendo Gugbridge.
Alright, I'm goin'.
Alright, I'm in.
Alright, Zee.
Alright, already!
Alright, already!
Alright, already.
Alright, alright!
Alright, alright, settle down.
Alright, alright. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't go romanticizing this place.
Alright, alright. Don't mean to be a bother.
Alright, alright. Forget I asked.
Alright, alright. He's dead.
Alright, alright. I'll let 'em off the hook fer now.
Alright, alright. Let's look.
Alright, boy!
Alright, boy.
Alright, boy.
Alright, buddy, this is the Haxion Brood's best. For whatever that's worth.
Alright, but I still owe you one. Heritage coming back safe is the talk of the saloon.
Alright, could use a lick of paint, more frequent dusting.
Alright, don't blame me when you pop a circuit.
Alright, don't let me keep ya.
Alright, fine. You're probably right. But it still, look it feels wrong with, well...
Alright, finish this thing, will ya?
Alright, follow me.
Alright, get him!
Alright, girl, let's go!
Alright, girl. 
Alright, got it.
Alright, it's only a matter of time before you run into 'em.
Alright, keep it together, Greez.
Alright, kid. Sit down. We're here. 
Alright, kid. Whenever you're ready.
Alright, laugh it up. We'll see who's right.
Alright, let's dance.
Alright, let's dance.
Alright, let's do it.
Alright, let's do this.
Alright, let's finish this.
Alright, let's get back to it. 
Alright, let's go!
Alright, let's go.
Alright, let's go.
Alright, let's move.
Alright, let's pick where we go next.
Alright, let's pull that orb before it falls off...
Alright, let's try planting those seeds we found.
Alright, listen.
Alright, maybe one little cup.
Alright, maybe that's optimistic.
Alright, not falling for that again.
Alright, now.
Alright, out with it. You're not carrying disruptor tech are ya? No? How about slicer droids? Don't lie to me.
Alright, ready to do some gardening?
Alright, so not a family man.
Alright, something new for the garden. No doubt Pili has some wisdom about it.
Alright, that one's a loser.
Alright, that's done. Back to patrol.
Alright, that's enough Turgle.
Alright, that's enough.
Alright, that's enough.
Alright, then! It's settled. Hey, I might be able to get a bargain - don't s'pose you'd want in?
Alright, then.
Alright, then.
Alright, then.
Alright, then.
Alright, then.
Alright, trying again.
Alright, you old bat...I'm in.
Alright, you take care of yourself.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright. 
Alright. 
Alright. But hurry up, would ya?
Alright. But you do seem happier now that she's around.
Alright. Guard the area.
Alright. I guess I'll leave you to it.
Alright. I thought the Nightsisters were all...gone.
Alright. I'll draw their fire, you hit them when they aren't looking.
Alright. I'll give it a little longer. 
Alright. I'll record the passage and make sure you return to us.
Alright. I'll scout ahead, meet you there.
Alright. I'll scout ahead, meet you there?
Alright. I'm going back to the cantina.
Alright. I'm gonna make us some food before we go.
Alright. Just you and me.
Alright. Let's check this out. 
Alright. Let's end this. 
Alright. Let's end this. 
Alright. Make like a rock and quit movin' around my cabin.
Alright. Maybe we can find something there to help us cross the Abyss.
Alright. Not like we've got much of a choice. I'll get us across this pit.
Alright. Primed and ready.
Alright. So, next...
Alright. Thanks, Greez.
Alright. That did it.
Alright. That's done.
Alright. That's it for me. 
Alright. Then let's grab a drink later.
Alright. When I was a few years younger than you, I was working the dredgers not far from the outpost.
Alright...
Alright...
Alright...
Alright...
Alright... I think we did it.
Alright... I think we did it.
Alright?
Also hard to imagine you as a farmer.
Also not as dumb as I first thought.
Also scanning...
Also, I met a couple of droids.
Alter formation. 
Alteration to gravity.
Although we're not exactly swimming in credits here.
Although, If you ask me, electron walls are overkill.
Always a pleasure, Cal.
Always a pleasure, Moran.
Always another way.
Always brings back memories...
Always consider the situation from multiple angles.
Always consider the situation from multiple angles.
Always consider the situation from multiple angles.
Always full of life, aren't you, BD-1?
Always giving me a new perspective, eh Cere?
Always glad to have you watching my back, Gabs.
Always good to see you!
Always here if you need me.
Always keepin' me on the straight and narrow, huh? There's a good droid.
Always nice to meet a fan.
Always on point. 
Always on the run. Scraping by for credits. Everyone hates me.
Always on the run. That's a hard life.
Always so much to do.
Always somethin' to do, huh?
Always something to do.
Always something to do.
Always something.
Always takes so long to get the sand out the engines.
Always talking to her plants.
Always the acrobat!
Always the practical one, aren't you dear?
Always wanted a voorling of my own. Cute lil' buggers.
Always wanted to collect a Jedi.
Always wanted to fight a rancor!
Always wanted to take a tour with a BX.
Always.
Always.
Always.
Always.
Always?
Am I all that's left?
Am I even close to hitting him? 
Am I glad to see you! Gotta a little proposition for your ears only!
Am I in your head?
Am I in your head?
Am I not coming with you?
Am I seein' things?
Am I seeing things?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Am I supposed to be scared of that?
Am I that easy to read?
Am I that easy to read?
Am I the only one gonna fight? 
Am I too much for you?
Am I too much for you? 
Am I... the last one?
Am I...a smelly insect in this metaphor?
Am... am I all that's left?
Amateur.
Amatuer.
Amazed that building is still standing.
Amazing kick!
Amazing.
Amazing.
Amazing. Its hide is nearly impenetrable.
Amazing. The sinking city of Kuratow, the Persaya cliffs.
Amazing. These things are playing off each other!
Ambush! Get on your feet!
Ambushes.
Amusing.
An Emergence?
An ISB base, really?
An Imperial shuttle. Who knows what kind of cargo it crashed with.
An Imperial shuttle?
An aerial display!
An aerial display!
An arm down!
An arm in a single strike!
An army, all ours.
An easy bounty!
An easy kill.
An easy kill.
An enemy approaches.
An enemy below.
An enemy using the Force.
An enemy with a light sword.
An enemy! Down there!
An enemy. 
An enemy. 
An enemy? Here?
An energy conduit. You don't have anything for it, do you?
An energy weapon.
An error. 
An evil person.
An excellent observation.
An excellent offense from Tulakt!
An expected result.
An expert play by Kestis.
An industrial world. Just like your homeworld, right?
An inferior combatant.
An inferno!
An installation that size...you gotta wonder how they aligned the optical resonator...
An insurgent! Down there!
An intelligent empire would co-opt the cultures it conquers, wielding it against their enemies.
An intruder has been identified. This base is now on lockdown.
An intruder! Above!
An intruder! Down there!
An intruder! Up there!
An intruder. 
An intruder...
An invader. Must be Bode!
An oasis, we're saved!
An old Anchorite monastery. Impressive, isn't it?
An old trick. Well, I stopped the sale. And Doma has been grateful ever since.
An old, old, old model. As old as Rayvis. 
An opening!
An outing with friends, oh how you miss the company when you've been deprived of it for two centuries!
An unexpected blessing, though I have some competition.
An unfortunate loss.
An' I like seeing the face on lubbers like ye when they realize just how many kinds o' fish there are in this galaxy.
An' I said, 'Yer command be forfeit if ye dinnae forswear ma home waters!'
An' fierce as they come - but that does nae deter the poachers.
An' put somethin' else in.
An' so my time aboard the Grapnel met a briny end:
An' this world on which I was weaned and warmed seemed but a moon tae me careworn eyes. So...small.
Analytical swing.
Analyze for patterns.
Analyze his patterns.
Analyzing acrobatics.
Anarchy is counter to my programming.
Ancient
Ancient droids.
Ancient history.
And BX liked both arms.
And Caij never seems to die.
And Cal Kestis ends it all! A holotactic champion.
And Cal comes out on top! He's advancing.
And Cal has to be happy with that.
And Cal takes one out!
And Cal's not too shabby in the fighting department either.
And Dagan murders them over it.
And Dagan sent his army to look for it.
And Force sensitives and those who help them.
And Greez knocks a unit down to size!
And Greez.
And I admire it, but it is not only his life we would risk.
And I adore both. You've never lived until you're danced the night away on a pleasure barge circling the Uscru District.
And I also found a source that says they smell with their ears!
And I am glad for it.
And I am smarter.
And I at Gido's. And we've been stuck together ever since. Because we shared something special.
And I feel the same, my friend.
And I gave you such good advice, for practically nothing!
And I got a sunburn on my gastro-dermis. Not fun.
And I have come for you.
And I have seen only a little of what it has to offer.
And I haven't walked straight since.
And I helped by staying out of the way. Did you know there's even a garden on the roof?
And I hitched a ride.
And I immediately found a new career. And star system.
And I intend to.
And I know a few unsavory sorts who wouldn't mind cashing in.
And I know, I know. You're a scientist; you can't wait to see what they'll unearth...
And I like to watch things grow.
And I need to know that I am doing the best that I can to ensure safety in the galaxy from destructive traitors.
And I never thought you'd settle down and run a saloon. That's quite a change of pace.
And I never wanted to come to this trash planet, but here we are.
And I respect anyone who keeps fighting even when the chips are down.
And I still have some Lateron nutmeg.
And I thought this guy was special.
And I thought we could be friends.
And I was looking forward to torturing you.
And I was so looking forward to breaking you myself.
And I was unable to help them, so I chose to remain here.
And I will be waiting.
And I you.
And I'm extremely impressionable!
And I've already told you enough about my past business to land me in an Imperial intake yard.
And I've been waiting a long time for this payday, Cal.
And I've got no doubt it's crawling with nasties.
And Iego's got a thousand moons. A thousand! That's so many!
And Koboh was right in the middle of it. This world is a window into a golden age.
And Master Cordova.
And Tulli moves to take a unit!
And a lot of responsibility.
And a quick cut.
And all this in-between could be... anything? Dangers?
And also because it hasn't...seen...much battle...
And another!
And at this time of day you'll say...
And aye, might be you're right.
And besides, we both know his captain's chair belongs in a starship.
And build a saloon!
And by 'we', you mean dirt you can sell to make some credits?
And compete with Doma?
And crush them.
And definitely don't invite those creepy sisters of yours.
And detain anyone in the area.
And determined as ever to tend to the Jedi legacy and resist the Empire.
And did I hear right that there is some sort of High Republic chamber beneath the cantina?
And did you...?
And don't you forget it!
And done!
And expose my favorite patron? Give me a little credit, Cal.
And find the Anchorites.
And finding out what happened to those poor souls, of course!
And for us as well. Sometimes I think she's all that's holdin' us together.
And friends.
And from what Cere tells me - willing to put your life on the line for those you love.
And give away our position. Are you crazy?
And he asks for nothing in return.
And he returns.
And he thinks this Kili Oso will make us pay.
And he's gone.
And he's gone. 
And her axe screams "Fight me! I dare you! I double dare you, you two-timing, dirty -"
And here I hoped that things might actually improve with the Raiders on the run.
And how are you today?
And how's that?
And if Dagan gets the compass, we win?
And if anyone makes it past all that, the Anchorites have plenty of holobooks to throw at them.
And if anyone sees the terrorist, let me handle him.
And if he puts on the saber, get back, right?
And if it does, he certainly won't reply. I wouldn't. Besides, there's no chance he'd actually come here.
And if it was?
And if not, maybe Zee does have a screw loose.
And if they do? Look around - the Empire's already here.
And if we don't?
And if you are destroyed?
And if you can't beat 'em...
And if you do not turn away, you will see my power for yourself.
And if you got real tired. Abel'd let you sleep on the floor.
And if you prefer, you can put plants in stasis at a size of your choosing!
And if you're dying of thirst, well, our drinks they ain't the worst.
And if you're dying of thirst, well, our drinks they ain't the worst.
And if you're dying of thirst, well, our drinks they ain't the worst.
And if you're dying of thirst, well, our drinks they ain't the worst.
And if you're running from a blaster, better run a little faster.
And if you're running from a blaster, better run a little faster.
And if you're running from a blaster, better run a little faster...
And if you're running from a blaster, better run a little faster...
And if you're running from a blaster...
And in case I don't?
And in our experience, change is no laughing matter.
And in situations like that folks tend to panic and act a fool. Now Doma and I have been talking -
And in the dark, with nothin' but the bristles on yer chin fer company, that focus is special.
And into the pockets of the politicians at the top.
And it doesn't hurt to have a 'desert ghost' on our side.
And it looks like they found us too. You ready?
And it took two weeks before we had reliable power and water.
And it's a goner.
And it's a headbutt from the bilemaw!
And it's a score! Score for Tina.
And it's all yours.
And it's much appreciated. He's a good find, boss.
And it's off the board.
And just how many credits will that take, you think?
And just when the Empire lets its guard down, that's when I strike!
And just where are you going?
And leave you in charge of the Mantis? No thanks.
And left me to rot in a cage for centuries.
And look where it got them.
And look, there's a commotion down by that turbolift.
And make no mistake, our enemies are ruthless. They will stop at nothing to destroy us.
And many more will die if we do not secure the hangar.
And me too,
And miss all this exciting patrol action? No, never.
And my papa?
And never stopped!
And no heroics!
And no one's seen her since.
And not getting shot.
And now it's time to prove my worth by taking down a Jedi!
And now it's too late!
And now look at you.
And now she never will.
And now we got a ragin' monster!
And now we gotta hold him back...
And now we settle this.
And now we wait.
And now you're a petty thief on the outer rim. Good job.
And now your neighbors are Imperials and Raiders.
And now, time for me and my lovely assistant to show you how it's done!
And of course the bridge is under construction.
And on our tail. We're trapped!
And one day,
And ours.
And push through!
And records show him frequently visiting a laboratory on its moon.
And risk a court-martial? No thanks.
And save as much of the Archive as we can.
And save lives.
And see more than they let on.
And shaking our heads at that whiny slump, Moran!
And so I cut a deal.
And so is happiness.
And so it was that I found maself once again in search o' the dread captain and his crew.
And so,
And so, I return to my apprentice's side with no regrets.
And some friends.
And something coming towards us, actually! What is that?
And stay alive.
And stronger.
And sure, the bed wasn't handcrafted on Alderaan.
And that ain't you.
And that brings us to this rube-riddled cantina, years later.
And that gives me strength. So I like to think I'm doing better than ever.
And that is a most ferocious charge!
And that magick of hers. Cloaks the Mantis, which I like. But does she have to chant to all her creepy sisters? Yeugh!
And that you lured me here to take down this base.
And that's how I pulled it off! No one thinks much of me around here. So they never see me coming!
And that's how it's done.
And that's how we like it!
And that's not you. Boy you love adventure. You need adventure. But also, I needed you to watch over the kid.
And that's that.
And that's what inspires all of us.
And that's why these locals don't stand a chance.
And the Bedlam Raiders.
And the Empire hasn't captured you yet? Impressive.
And the Empire is still hunting them down.
And the Empire's there too.
And the Empire?
And the Jedi Council ordered Khri to destroy the compasses.
And the Jedi?
And the aphren swarm that ate the town's food supply. No one knew what to do!
And the bad news?
And the bilemaw goes for a stomp.
And the company is not so bad, either.
And the contact codes.
And the customers keep coming.
And the more they talk, the more I learn about what makes them tick.
And the other half worship the Jedi.
And the prospectors?
And the rest of the outpost didn't take long to follow.
And the same to you, and you.
And the sky was full of meteors.
And the sooner the powers-that-be realize that fact, the more prosperous our Empire will become.
And the swindler?
And the walker delivers the bang-bang-boom.
And their lives are terrible.
And then I'll shoot him again.
And then guess who volunteers to fly in alone and discovers a planet on the other side?
And then if I get my hands on some... yeah, yeah, that's great!
And then there was one.
And then there was one.
And then there's the Raiders, and the bugs...
And then there's the Raiders, and the bugs...
And then they'll take what they want, including whatever bygone baubles you're hunting for out there.
And then us.
And then we'll have no one left to make fun of.
And then we'll put it all back together again!
And then what, you're gonna go find some trouble with Saw Gerrera?
And then, the entire planet.
And there are always leaves to prune. Greez thought she might like it here.
And there it is, right on cue.
And there never will be on my watch.
And there's a lotta creatures up there. Some of 'em won't even eat ya!
And these noble beasts demand respect, y'know? As you'll see.
And they call 'em 'super' droids...
And they never will.
And they say he's a Jedi.
And this ain't a one-way trip. We can still visit, right?
And this is BD-1.
And this planet has much to teach us.
And those moves! Incredible! Where did you learn to do that!?
And those outfits of his, I'm not sure he even cleans them.
And threw me in a watering hole.
And thus by reframing it, a problem may not seem so vexing after all.
And to keep your eyes on the path ahead.
And to tell you that there could be treasure right beneath your very nose.
And to think one day our children will ask what is this thing?
And to you as well, Cal.
And to you.
And treasure. Might be worth checking out.
And trust me when I tell you, you do not want to know the kinds of noises Turgle makes in his sleep...
And trust that, whatever the odds,
And turn my back on another bounty hunter?
And turned to the dark side.
And um...
And watch out for rocks.
And we appreciate all your help, Cal. These tracks are exactly what this space needed.
And we brought him in alive!
And we can't stop now.
And we could catch him there.
And we could use all the help we can find.
And we don't do much running!
And we have a new type of plant. Wonder if Pili has something to say about it.
And we like trouble.
And we simply can't procure those ingredients out here. 
And we're back.
And we're following the same trail...
And we're off.
And we're too old to fight 'em!
And we've got bigger fish to fry than these Raider hacks.
And what a glider! Oh, wait. It's holding something.
And what about him?
And what do we get?
And what is that?
And what is the nature of this appointment?
And what was the reason for this flagrant breach of protocol?
And what you're not.
And what's the ugliest you've seen?
And when Rayvis' oath is fulfilled, so too will be ours.
And when exactly did Rayvis put you in charge?
And when the Empire comes?
And when the rain comes...
And where are they now?
And where is he now?
And where is her mother now?
And where's that gotten ya, Cal?
And whether the hunt was worth their time... or their lives.
And who are these wolves in this vision of yours?
And who was in this dream of yours?
And who's this?
And why would I do that?
And with a bit of your slicing, this temple could once again provide safe haven for those who need it most.
And with you.
And worse, these prospecting fools want me to throw that party for free.
And would that be so bad?
And yet I am still operational.
And yet it is not.
And yet it stands.
And yet there's a unique peace to it.
And yet we've reached an impasse. Perhaps you will bring me some much-needed luck.
And yet you persevere. Perhaps you'll surprise me.
And yet, it serves drinks, and doesn't close its doors when the Bedlam Raiders march into town.
And yet...
And you -
And you are?
And you are?
And you call yourself a Jedi.
And you can always find 'em all inside the saloon. That's why we're just fine staying out here.
And you go over here.
And you helped them out, for a price.
And you knew she didn't want to because she complained about it all day, every day.
And you know who to blame, don't ya?
And you must be Dagan Gera.
And you must not let it consume you.
And you old timers act grumpy.
And you survived? You are more proficient than I assessed.
And you tamed one right outta the gate? You're a natural, Cal!
And you think I deceive them?
And you think that could happen to us?
And you think the Bedlam Raiders are bad.
And you wanted to sit this one out.
And you were going to sacrifice thousands of people to save yourself!
And you will again, Greez.
And you'll check again in another hour, if that's what it takes.
And you're my third favorite patrol partner.
And you're not alone. Not anymore.
And you're programmed to say that.
And you're so often at the center of things. Careful, careful.
And you're standing in the way of a better life for my little girl.
And you're supposed to be the barker. Bark, Bhima. Bark.
And you, Zee.
And you.
And your order approves?
And yours makes you boring.
And, I did not know how he'd react to our decision to destroy the holocron.
And, by the stars, they bought it! The inspectors actually bought it.
And, planted.
And, uh, if ye did rinse yerself off in the waters, I'd nae mind.
And...
And?
And?
And?
And?
Anger.

Annihilate him.
Annihilate the pest.

Another, BD.
Another.
Another. 
Answer them!
Anticipate his movements!
Anxious, Jedi?
Any Jedi who survived this long must be a threat. Be vigilant.
Any Raider news?
Any Raider run-ins?
Any chance that you know how to make an Arkanisian Sunrise?
Any chance you might have any, uh, 'entrepreneurial' prophecies to offer?

As if my day wasn't bad enough.
As if there's a Jedi here. Have you ever seen one?
As if they weren't useless enough.

Aye - but, though it brings a tear to ma eye, I fear we may be reaching capacity.
Aye, I'll take one. In fact, I'll take a whole litter maself! Put 'em right here wi' the rest o' the fish in me tank.
Aye, aye, the loading ramp! Now, will ye hush and let Skoova tell the story?!
Aye, boy. The subtle art of catchin' a fish. The art of focus.
Aye, but this is no' the time fer self-congratulation, laddie.
Aye, even now, it brings the salt to ma eyes.
Aye, lad, go ahead and ponder, but don't ponder yer years down the river. There's always - always - another fish.
Aye, lad. There I sat, tummy arumble, gazing out at the void, ma somber reflection staring back from the porthole.
Aye, ma hesitance tae pull the trigger had me undone.
Aye, ma tenure began with quite a bump!
Aye, our story nears its end: I had discovered that Captain Whett was plunderin' me very home seas fer exotic fish...
Aye, so we return to ma time on the Grapnel.
Aye, takes me back. Stick around, boy, and I'll top us off wi' a tale.
Aye, that one slipped the line - but sarcasm is weak bait!
Aye, the dread captain stroked his briny beard. After a long moment, he held out his hand and grinned most terribly:

Beats me. Kid's usually got a plan. Usually.
Beats standing around.
Beautiful. It's a paradise. A haven. Not just somewhere to hide, but somewhere to live.
Bebep Wrrr!
Because I have a business proposition that will make your eye-stems spin!
Because I like fish, Cal.
Because I'm a father who's running out of options.
Because he won't serve me anymore. Tab, shmab. I'll give him credits when I got credits.
Because the ISB has failed, so we must do your work for you.
Because then I get to blast them.
Because they lack the true devotion to slay traitors.
Because this organization is pathetic. At best a waste of Imperial resources.
Because this time it's personal. You've beaten them before and they're hungry for revenge, Jedi.
Because you are growing by the minute...I can practically see you sprouting!
Because you know a lot of stuff. And I don't.

Been a long time for me.
Been a while since I was on Coruscant.
Been a while since I was up close to a Lucrehulk.
Been a while since we took a break.
Been all over Koboh - but I knew I had to footslog it back to the Reach when I heard the stories.
Been here a while. Maybe they're one of the missing prospectors.
Been here plenty of cycles. Didn't used to be this way.
Been itching for some action. 
Been looking for you!
Been looking forward to this, tin bin.
Been practicing?
Been practicing?
Been seein' you around quite a bit. Thinking about a permanent residence, eh?
Been waitin' a long time for this payday.
Been waitin' a long time to kill you.
Been waitin' for this showdown.
Been waiting for this!
Been waiting for you!
Been wanting to kill a Jedi my whole life.

Before Cal can put the pieces together Dagan 'bleeds' his lightsaber from blue to red and attacks,
Before I could shake my flippers, the barb of his harpoon spun though the deep -
Before I deliver you to the Emperor, you will lead me to the remaining Jedi.
Before I go, do you want me to scrap the droid?
Before all this, I was a petty thief in the core worlds.
Before he can say more, Cal invites the discombobulated droid to the Cantina, in the hopes that Greez might restore him.
Before lunchtime, they're blazin' skytrails - never hear from 'em again!
Before the Empire, I fought for sport. Undefeated.
Before this assignment, I'd never heard of Purge Troopers. What does it take to be one?
Before, I mean - the Knight who led his Order to such an age of discovery.
Beg for mercy!
Beg for mercy!
Begin firing.
Begin patience protocols.
Begin solo strategy.
Begin vertical search routine. 
Begin your assault.
Beginning assault.
Beginning cleansing process.
Beginning final assault.

Beginning the search.
Beheaded!
Behind this helmet, you'd never know if I was a droid just like you.
Behold true power.
Behold!
Behold!
Behold!
Behold! Imports!
Being Careful
Being in command means the Raiders trust me.
Being paid a visit from the Purge division cannot be good.
Being parried.
Being still is not one of your strengths.
Being thorough. I don't want to give the Purge Troopers any reason to be angry.
Being up there won't help.
Belief is a construct.
Belief is irrelevant.
Believe in the Force.
Believe it!

Besides, Cal might get lonely, and BD misses me, you know?
Besides, I ain't gambled since the Brood took you prisoner.
Besides, I think Greez could use the company.
Besides, I've been in worse predicaments. With far worse employers.
Besides, I've gathered ma focus for ma quarry: the fearsome glottsamcrab.
Besides, he is here on Master Junda's auspices. Not Narkis, I'll grant you - but hardly an outsider.
Besides, if the Raiders come around again, I've got your back.
Besides, there are worse things than prospectors on this planet.
Besides, you didn't even see Fortress Inquisitorius. 
Besides, you two look like you have, uh...a lot to catch up on.
Besides.
Besides.
Besides...
Best do as they say, let's not make this any messier than it needs be.
Best if it didn't grow any more than it already has.
Best kept where you are.
Best not delay any further.
Best not to risk it.
Best selection in the system, guaranteed.
Best take a look.
Best way to hide from the Empire is right under their noses.
Best way up is through the Array.
Bestial deceased.
Bet I can mine more than you in a day.

Bet this big lever does something.
Bet we can use your grinder to clear the matter.
Bet we'd make half the time now.
Bet y'all'd make a nice mount. Well, not you. You're dead as dirt.
Bet ya can't dodge this.
Bet you can't hit me!
Bet you make more credits that way.
Bet you've got some stories!
Bet you've never been in a fist fight.
Better be careful. Who knows if there's another rancor down there?
Better be careful. Who knows if there's another rancor down there?

Better check it out. 
Better get a closer look.
Better get on this.
Better get our autographs now, Cal. Next time we meet, we might be above your paygrade.
Better go look. 
Better heal, Kestis!
Better here than off-world.
Better hurry. Otherwise you'll never get promoted. 
Better keep moving or we'll end up like them.
Better look into that. 
Better look into that. 
Better look into that. 
Better look into this. 
Better luck next time, huh?
Better now.
Better run.
Better start beggin'.
Better stay over there!
Better than a dead one, son. Ain't that what matters?
Better than alright! I've got a plan.
Better than alright! Oh, wait...you were talkin' about my arm, weren't you?
Better than my former employers, I can tell you that.
Better the devil you know, and so forth.
Better to ask Cere yourself. Meanwhile, Merrin and I will greet our new arrivals.
Better us than the yacht, yeah?
Better watch yourself out there, Cal. Raiders and Imps are at each other's throats.
Better watch yourselves. 
Better watch!
Better watch!
Better you than me.
Better.
Better.
Better.
Better. That tea you brought me was wonderful.
Better?
Between the Empire and the local wildlife, seems like a dangerous place to me.
Between you and me, I think the management is much improved.
Between you and me, though, she could sometimes be a little bit of a nag.

Bode Akuna is at the bar looking for Cal Kestis. Greez feigns ignorance when Cal and Zee enter.
Bode and I were able to find some interesting data in the archives.
Bode betrayed us to the Empire. We lost good friends on Jedha.
Bode has been my weapon for some time.
Bode has the compass, go after him!
Bode lost that fight.
Bode lured you here to destroy me!
Bode must have gotten their attention.
Bode offers to escort Greez out to the Mantis and keep the Raiders off his back while Cal investigates the Forest Array.
Bode set up the ISB.
Bode should be just up ahead.
Bode throws in with Cal: he is wanted by the Empire
Bode told me everything! Both pistols blazing, a real crackshot straight outta the holovids!
Bode told me what happened on Coruscant.
Bode volunteers to stay back on Cowboy World and defend the outpost
Bode will not let this end peacefully. 
Bode won't get away with this.

Bode's here, alright. Got a place in the officer's quarters.
Bode, Bravo. Are you there?
Bode, go!
Bode, it's so good to hear from you. I feared you might have slipped your leash permanently. 
Bode, we're heading to the observatory.
Bode, what have you gotten yourself involved in this time?

Bow before me, Jedi.
Bow before your superior.
Bow down!
Boy you have taken us through some scrapes, that's for sure.
Boy, this place is a magnet for trouble. Raiders, prospectors, liars...
Bracca rat!
Brace for impact.

Brood's calling, Jedi!
Brood's got eyes on a Jedi!
Brood's on to your tricks, Jedi.
Brood's waiting!
Brother Armias can't hide forever.
Brother Armias is still in there.
Brother Armias served the cause faithfully - and that service lives on through our determination to keep moving forward.
Brother, I meant to mention - we recovered two dozen manuscripts yesterday.
Brother, don't ignore me. You can't stop me, I won't let you!
Brother, perhaps you should revisit the fifth book. And, while you're there, revisit the preceding books as well.
Brothers, Sisters, we have a most honored guest!
Brought a couple of lackeys with her, but pick off the alpha and the pack will scatter.
Brought in some bramlik yesterday.
Brr?
Brutal force detected.
Brutal!
Brutal, but effective.
Brutal.

Busy keeping these customers in fine fettle, Cal.
Busy right now!
Busy!
Busy, busy - no, not now, stranger! Let me be...let me be. Much on the mind.
Busy, busy.
But -
But - I'd have a neon sign with my name on it. And that'd make Great-Grandma Pyloon mighty proud.
But Doma says that's what I'm best at!
But Dreyo, my partner - he wanted to leave, together.
But Gabs,
But I appreciate the warning, Cal. I'll keep an eye out.
But I can hold ma breath fer ages!
But I can manage.
But I can run, and jump! Real fast, real high!
But I do hate what they've done to this outpost.
But I do miss my ship.
But I do not intend tae harvest the poor creature fer its organs...
But I do recall this: after a term most interminable, there she was! Like a bowsprit cuttin' through a crest!
But I do. It's just, it's a complicated piece of -
But I don't hate it.
But I had a plan in my head and that's more than anyone in this outpost could say.
But I hate this place...
But I haven't even told you the scheme! Wait for it. Rancor petting zoo! Eh?
But I imagine owning multiple luxury homes across the galaxy. As my fame and fortune grow.
But I know what I saw, lad. I know what I saw.
But I said no.
But I shall stay here for the time being. I've grown rather fond of this cantina.
But I think he was most proud of being your father.
But I thought Dagan knew everything?
But I was wrong.
But I will certainly try.
But I will escort you back to the Mantis.
But I will say, you done good around here, Cal. Makes me wanna do better, too.
But I will.
But I would sooner feed my credits to a monkey-lizard than go into business with the likes of you.
But I'd settle for just seeing Kata again soon.
But I'll find someone who'll do it and won't ask questions.
But I'll get there. I hope.
But I'll make it right. I have to.
But I'm happy for ye. S'not a simple business fer a wind-tossed soul to drop their anchor.
But I'm scared.
But I've come this far. Too much blood. Just a little further now.
But I've got my orders. So get out of here!
But I've havered on long enough. Come back another time and I'll tell ye more.
But I've never been to Birren, so why don't you tell me more about them, okay?
But Kata still has a chance.
But Santari purged that knowledge from Zee's memory banks.
But Santari said that Dagan was the key to Tanalorr.
But Taule, the old nutter, she goes and takes her plasma torch to the Gen'Dai!
But Turgle's middle name is tab.
But Zee's in there. We're not leaving without her.
But a keen one. Let us not appraise his esteem lightly.
But a little caution is wise. Gossip always travels faster than light.
But a true fisher knows that a pocketful of luck is more important than some cod migration pattern!
But all that you see here on Koboh is her work, one way or another.
But ambition does not drive you.
But are you?
But bad memories do not stay forever. We can replace them with better ones.
But beneath all of that, he actually believed that a coupla nobodies like us could strike it rich.
But betting against the Empire? That's taking the long odds.
But blind as we were at such depth, we shortly ran into a dead end, findin' ourselves surrounded by Quarren...
But buying a beverage doesn't oblige you to drink it, you know.
But can you use it?
But can you use it?
But can you use it?
But death is not always what we know. Throughout our lives, we must let the old shell fall behind.
But do you think you could teach me a few tricks sometime?
But don't let it determine your path.
But enough recognized the sanctity of the calling to follow her along the path.
But ever since then you've been reckless.
But fer all me bellyaching now, 'twas a peaceful enough life fer a wee Sakavian with an instinct fer the rod.
But for now my place is on Jedha with Cere.
But for the record, your friendly demeanor don't fool me one bit.
But he gave his life for this.
But he seems to be doing okay.
But he's the only one who attended my illuminating seminar on self-propagating business solutions.
But her bounty will fetch a handsome price.
But hey - it's a basement! Cut yourself some slack, Greez. He likes it...
But hit me up if you have other suggestions, yeah?
But how would we know, is my point? If they're inside our minds!?
But how?!
But if Rayvis is on his way there, that's where we need to be too.
But if someone named Dreyo comes in here asking for me...just put in a good word, will you?
But if the boss says there's something here, who am I to question it...
But if the compass is gone, do not despair. You -
But if the compass is gone, do not despair. You -
But if we find something here that'll help us navigate the Koboh Abyss, so be it.
But if you want to know something, I have all sorts of tips for Koboh visitors.
But ignorance can be bliss, right?
But in my line of work, failing to discern a business partner's mental state could sour the whole deal.
But in success will you also find an ever-greater connection to the Force.
But in there, I have other tools at my disposal. Or maybe I'll just use this!
But instead of scrapping Separatist warships, we're salvaging what we can from the Jedi of the High Republic.
But is it even possible to find a new datapad on a planet like this?
But is the river's course its birthright? Is the stone due its form?
But isn't the Empire all-powerful?
But it can be so challenging to access.
But it comforts me to know that you might continue this path in my stead.
But it did introduce me to a steady procession of people desperate for things to 'shake out' in their favor.
But it didn't.
But it doesn't have to define you.
But it feels different. Older.
But it is heartening to see that some bright spots yet remain.
But it kept the troops entertained for a while.
But it never worked out.
But it was a trap.
But it's hardly sporting to walk away from the game when the wind's at your back.
But it's missing something.
But it's possible...
But it's where Kata grew up, so there are good memories with the bad.
But just as importantly, I know the thrill of hyperspace and have watched the sun set on a dozen worlds.
But kinda creepy though.
But left unchecked, it will consume everything in its path...
But listen to me.
But ma demented expression put such a fright on the Quarren that they dropped their blasters!
But mistakes like these can not be tolerated!
But most of all...
But mostly the ugly.
But much like healthy roots, do not overextend yourself.
But my encounter with Oondun had given me a taste fer the unknown.
But my orders are to protect you.
But no matter what, I am committed to learning some more...practical skills.
But none of this would've happened if I wasn't trying to make a quick credit. I'm a murderer!
But not two days later, that rawka blasts his way into a cavern crawlin' with priorite!
But nothing we've done has slowed them down.
But nothing. Quit giving me orders. Shut it!
But now that he's gone, it's liberating in a way. To let the past truly become past.
But now they got some muscle. I can hear them buzzing around.
But now you're gone.
But now, I don't know, I'm wondering if you don't have a home, can you truly be a family?
But now, I'm a frog reborn!
But now, the search for Master Santari's compass nears its end.
But old Tendo had one thing worth more'n any of that: the bastard was plum lucky.
But on a cold night like tonight,
But once more, the noble Jedi Knights rise to the occasion!
But one attempts to make the viewer bigger, and the other...so much smaller.
But one day,
But one pesky officer decided to kick open a shipping container full of, uh, slightly incriminating powder.
But others disagreed?
But our labor is driven by the belief that knowledge expresses universal truth.
But perhaps I could interest you in an Iodized Ghaant Roast, mm? An old favorite of yours, I believe...
But perhaps not.
But power is everything. Power is freedom.
But saving those folks, that's the important thing, course.
But scarcely had the lubbers set boot on the deck o' the Grapnel when wham!
But sending a droid instead of facing me yourself, such cowardice.
But seriously, it's just gettin' more and more dangerous around here.
But seriously, it's no laughing matter.
But she didn't come alone. And I don't remember any rules on Ordo Eris. Things might get messy.
But she still did because that's what you do for the ones you care about.
But sir, it was checked an hour ago.
But some day,
But some of my other responsibilities, back of the house work...
But some of them...I lost people I didn't expect to lose.
But somethin' else happened. I think, when that fell tentacle struck me,
But somethin' stopped me from pullin' the trigger.
But something has happened,
But something tells me there's more to this than just holobooks.
But sweetens with time.
But that armor was tough!
But that be a story fer another time.
But that be a tale fer another time.
But that be a tale fer another time.
But that is not the point! Remain at your post!
But that won't stop the Empire from reducing it to rubble.
But the Council...well, let's just say that my warnings fell on deaf ears.
But the Empire is not the Republic, and they are not just a nuisance. They're tyrants and murderers.
But the Haxion Brood's after me and she's got the intel on them.
But the code is about strength, power, freedom!
But the ferocious captain did nae care fer our troubles. With a belch, he produced from his creel a mighty harpoon!
But the most important thing is to know what you're fighting for.
But then I met the most incredible woman.
But then I'd be an empty metal case.
But then every hunter we took down drove your value up.
But then he died when his shuttle crashed.
But then they just listen to the propaganda and they pretend they're free anyways.
But then you must teach Greez.
But there is a galaxy full of people who have suffered as we have.
But there were strings attached.
But there's no other way up to the pillar, either.
But they also know nothin' of survival.
But they aren't lacking in principle or dedication. They have a code.
But they don't give you a ship for graduating! And, well, the family, we didn't have much back then either.
But they weren't rooted, you know? And it took me about sixteen years to figure out that I wasn't rooted, either.
But they will always be against us.
But they'll find the safe house eventually. Let's keep moving.
But they're here now, Greez.
But they're on the back foot. You can't have a cult of personality without a figurehead.
But things are a lot like under the Republic - we go about our lives, send delegates to the Senate, vote...
But things are probably going to get worse before we can make them better.
But things have changed since you've been gone.
But this feels like a trap.
But this is a lot of pretty interestin' tech you have here.
But this is not you!
But this one doesn't look like it's moved in a while.
But this place is our home now.
But this place will bleed you dry. Understand? Get out while you can.
But this sort of thing is why I came here in the first place. I'm not going anywhere.
But those can't happen on Koboh. Not anymore.
But to what cause?
But to what purpose, I wonder?
But tragedy's struck, Cal. I lost it! I'm aimless, adrift. I don't know what to do!
But turns out I ain't so smart. Let's try and take this varmint down.
But walking away isn't an option for me.
But we all knew it was Tendo and his lucky tailbone that got us that first big find.
But we cannot be frightened away from every planet the Empire terrorizes.
But we choose how to play!
But we don't have that kind of time, or resource.
But we have orders!
But we know for sure Rayvis is already on his way there.
But we know how to handle Jedi. Don't we, BD?
But we're lucky - it looks intact. If I'm right, it's been out here for centuries.
But we've got to get the word out before the competitors swarm us.
But wham! Just as we dove out of hyperspace an' the great ocean world streaked into view...
But what If I get assigned to garbage duty?!
But what about Bode?
But what about Kata?
But what does he even want with a pile of old ruins?
But what does he even want with this pile of antiquated tech?
But what if we run into an enemy?
But what is clear is that caution is faith - to our cause, and to Master Junda's.
But what ye don't know is that the barbed hookfish always travels northward.
But what's it for?
But when I feel weak, I can think of you and Trilla, and remember I still have the choice to do better.
But when I tried to get a closer look at one, it snatched my datapad and flew away.
But when active, I have often heard noises from deeper within. Rattles, scuffles, perhaps voices.
But where are we gonna find one around here?
But where's the skriton?
But why here?
But would you die for the Empire?
But wouldn't you know it, deep down I was just born to dance, Cal.
But ye can no more fit a Besalisk in a lurker's lair than an oyster in a thimble.
But ye did snap me fishing rod with yer clumsy boot.
But yes.
But you are faster!
But you are not killer like Garra. You are deaf to the call of battle!
But you don't hear about that.
But you got here a little sooner than I expected.
But you have cleared the way. Are the Raiders gone, then?
But you have to remember that where you lead, they will follow.
But you have to surrender.
But you heard that guy... these winds never stop.
But you know as much, enlightened one.
But you know what? I wouldn't choose any other.
But you should concern yourself more with surviving.
But you stood your ground, Cal.
But you want what I want.
But you were designed to obey orders - now move.
But you were gonna give it to the Hidden Path -
But you were just...
But you were right.
But you were trying to restore the Order, rebuild what was lost.
But you won't do it to me - even your s-sorcery can't get through 15 centimeters of Imperial-manufacture transparisteel!
But you'd tell me if you saw one, yeah?
But you'll never get past without the access codes. And I ain't squealin'.
But you're a droid, you don't have to.
But you're hurtin' bad inside, Kestis.
But you're not even wearing the proper robes!
But you're right. If I had to guess, something big and mean is gonna swallow up those Raiders.
But you...you I owe nothing.
But you...you I owe nothing.
But, hey...
But, in my infinite wisdom, I decided to stick it out, try to turn the cards in my favor. I got greedy.
But, it would mean leaving the fight, and...the fight is all I know.
But, plucky as I was, it could nae digest me before fishing fellows pulled us out.
But, the Force is present in all things, and we should never discount its influence.
But, uh, what kind of lethal creatures are we talkin' about?
But, you know it's kind of heavy, if anybody wanted to give me a hand that would be nice.
But.
But...you're here now. We can fight them. Together.
But?
Buy something this time, will ya?

By all means. I'm sure he has much to teach you.
By chance a friendly bystander diagnosed my predicament and graciously installed a replacement.
By saving you the trouble of serving me drinks by serving myself!
By shifting our position, so too moves our thinking.
By the Order... you are a Jedi!
By the right of the Council, Cal Kestis.
By the time they'd come tae their senses, we were swimmin' away as fast as our flippers could carry us!
Bye bye, now.

Caij warned us that this bounty hunter was cunning. Goes for the rest of his crew.
Caij was just...better!
Caij was right, Sorc's still clinging to that grudge.
Caij was right, the Haxion Brood's taken over the region.
Caij was superior on the offense!
Caij wasn't kidding about the Raiders working with the Haxion Brood.
Caij will want to see this.
Caij. It's been a while.
Caij? More like a mutually beneficial business partnership.

Cal! Come back!
Cal! Don't show up out of nowhere like that, you'll scare the salt out of me.
Cal! Have ye time fer a chuckle? I've a wee joke for ye.
Cal! I don't know what you did, but those vulture droids are makin' a hasty exit.
Cal! I hear I have you to thank for finding Zee!
Cal! I heard you stopped the Raiders. Well, you're not the only one with amazing news.
Cal! I've got a question for an accomplished warrior like yourself.
Cal! Look at all that's happening around here.
Cal! Look at this saloon!
Cal! Oh sisters, not again...
Cal! To what do I owe the pleasure?
Cal! What happened?
Cal! Y'know, this saloon always brightens up when you walk in.
Cal! You're not just gonna let him take me away, right?
Cal! You've missed a right squall around here! Where have you been?
Cal! You've seen that waterfall near the forest right?
Cal's just lookin' around a little, that's all.
Cal, BD, well-timed. I remembered a second location you might wish to explore.
Cal, BD, well-timed. I've another location you might wish to explore in the southern desert.
Cal, Cal, Cal.
Cal, I always adore seeing you. But you won't find the key to Tanalorr in this cantina, now will you?
Cal, I appreciate you sticking up for the Reach. Could sure use more like you.
Cal, I don't want to be "that droid," but Tanalorr won't discover itself.
Cal, I gotta confess something.
Cal, I gotta confess something.
Cal, I happened to notice that the spices are all filled to the brim.
Cal, I heard about a meditation chamber...
Cal, I hope I'm not intruding, but what happened to your Jedi Master?
Cal, I swear I had nothing to do with Zee being droidnapped!
Cal, I think they want some more.
Cal, I'm feeling blue!
Cal, I've been meaning to ask...
Cal, I've been meaning to, uh...
Cal, I've got connections to some Imperial channels. Seems like Koboh is on the Empire's agenda now.
Cal, I've seen so many stormtroopers in the valley, lately. I fear the Empire is taking control of Koboh.
Cal, after this job's done, maybe you and I get a bite? Talk about the future?
Cal, also freelance. You planning on doing more exploring?
Cal, another time, yes? I'm awaiting my oil bath.
Cal, are you coming?
Cal, are you dreaming?
Cal, buddy. You ain't been 'ere long, have you?
Cal, can I tell you one thing?
Cal, can you hear me? This way!
Cal, can you hear me?!
Cal, did you find the spot I was telling you about?
Cal, did you hear? That fool Grock got done in by an Imperial patrol.
Cal, did you hear? That fool Grock got done in by an Imperial patrol.
Cal, did you say something?
Cal, do you have a second? 
Cal, find Tanalorr. Imagine how many lives we could save.
Cal, focus!
Cal, get it!
Cal, get up. Cal!
Cal, glad you're here.
Cal, glad you're here.
Cal, good to see ya!
Cal, have you been exposed to any high-frequency photon beams lately?
Cal, he's gone!
Cal, help!
Cal, hey! That projection wave that came down from the moon - you know anything about that?
Cal, how do you do it?
Cal, how good to see you!
Cal, how'd ya sleep?
Cal, how'd you and Greez meet?
Cal, if the Empire gets those codes, it will endanger the entire network. We can't let them down.
Cal, if you missed me, that's all you had to say.
Cal, is it time?
Cal, is it true? Is Rayvis really gone?
Cal, just in time! The old grouch just made the best decision of his life.
Cal, just in time.
Cal, lad!
Cal, lad!
Cal, lad! I've a matter of grave importance tae discuss.
Cal, lad! Oho, yer in fer a treat!
Cal, laddie! Ahoy!
Cal, let's chat later. Zee and I are catching up on the state of the galaxy.
Cal, let's get a move on.
Cal, let's sync up and ship out, yeah?
Cal, ma lad. Ye've got the long-stare in yer eyes.
Cal, my boy, I'll tell you the same thing I told those Raiders:
Cal, my friend. Have you made the acquaintance of Sister Taske?
Cal, no!
Cal, no!
Cal, no!
Cal, old boy, we're way out in the Outer Rim - the outskirts of the Outer Rim. In a sleepy, dusty cantina no one visits.
Cal, old boy...
Cal, over here.
Cal, please, I read this from a very reputable holo-net source..
Cal, please.
Cal, please. I can't last much longer.
Cal, shouldn't you be hittin' the hyperlanes or whatever?
Cal, tell me. Have you ever been to Coruscant?
Cal, the Empire's set its sights on Koboh, and everyone's jumping planet!
Cal, the wall!
Cal, there you are.
Cal, this way.
Cal, to the right, see that?
Cal, watch out!
Cal, watch out!
Cal, we gotta go!
Cal, welcome back! Ready to give it your all?
Cal, were you really riding a Nekko? Or is Turgle tellin' tales?
Cal, what are you doing out here?
Cal, what are you doing out here?
Cal, what do you think?
Cal, what's up with that...woman who showed up with ya?
Cal, where you going!?
Cal, while you're here, could I run something by you?
Cal, would you please enlighten your friend here about our adventures on Dathomir?
Cal, you been holding out on me?
Cal, you can't fight your way out of some situations.
Cal, you coming?
Cal, you don't have time for this fight.
Cal, you have saved me. But I must ask more of you still.
Cal, you see that?
Cal, you were just a child when they sent you off to war.
Cal, you're back! How goes the search for Tanalorr?
Cal, you're back. Did you find anything?
Cal.

Cal. When we were fighting Dagan, those hallucinations - what were they for you?
Cal: "Come on BD, I think they've had enough company for one day."
Cal: "She won't be flying anytime soon, not without repairs."
Cal: "She won't be flying anytime soon, not without repairs... Greez will not be happy about this..."
Cal?!
Calamitous, indeed...
Calculated.
Calculations unsupported.
Calibrating estimations.
Call for backup!
Call it in, we've located a Jedi.
Call it in.
Call it in.
Call it in. Another one down. Rayvis will want to know.
Call it in. Target down.
Call it luck.
Call it off. 
Call me Harr. Been 'ere longer than any of these greenhorns.
Call me a loon, but I'm startin' to think Turgle might have a hand in all of this.
Callin' it quits? 
Calm down, that's just the wind.
Calm down, you're becoming a distraction.
Calm? We're on the verge of slaying a traitor.
Calmer than a sleeping bantha.
Came all alone when I was a little sprout. Age of twelve, if you can believe it.
Came to see that incredible High Republic structure - didn't expect to have to fight off beasts with my field journal.

Cannot calculate.
Cantina on Norsid. Bounty hunter got the drop on me.
Cantina's crumblin' up there, and there's ghosts or somethin' in the tunnels.
Cantina's got some great tunes, but could always be more!
Capital! Hark:
Captain Dritus, a moment of your time?
Captain says I'm well-rounded!
Capture was inevitable.
Care and listen to our botanical friends.
Care for a game?
Care to challenge someone, holotactician?
Care to gaze upon sacred treasure?
Care to hear something in particular? Just let Deedee know.
Care to play a game of holotactics?
Care to see what I've found?
Careful - the weapon is live!
Careful - their head is pure exoskeleton!
Careful BD.
Careful around here, bud. Nobody's used these tunnels for a long time now.
Careful around this one.
Careful not to touch anything here, BD.
Careful not to touch anything here.
Careful now.
Careful now.
Careful of those pincers!
Careful on the hunt today.
Careful out there, sport. Seems plenty of sinister fellows are coming out of the woodwork these days.

Centuries ago,
Centuries ago, folks couldn't wait to scratch out a living under a new sky. And hell, they sure chose a vibrant world!
Centuries of conflict have honed me against your kind!
Cere -
Cere Junda. I will bring your head to Vader!
Cere and Cordova are gone.
Cere and Cordova are waiting.
Cere and Cordova revived this safe haven. Now the Empire's knocking it down forever.
Cere and I believe Tanalorr could be a refuge for those persecuted by the Empire.
Cere and I have been through a lot together.
Cere and Master Cordova chose it as the Hidden Path's safe house.
Cere and her master are quite the pair. They've been a vital asset to the Path since they joined us.
Cere bought enough time for BD-1 to reach us with the contact codes for the Hidden Path.
Cere channels strength.
Cere has gone to great lengths to ensure that nothing found in one site would lead to the other.
Cere has mentioned your connection to the past. You feel history by instinct.
Cere has told me everything.
Cere is one of us, if not by creed, then through her commitment to our cause.
Cere protects us!
Cere says Jedha was once home to many who revered your kind.
Cere speaks highly of you, you know.
Cere tells me you were trained in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.
Cere trained them, so they've got to be tough. I'm sure some of them made it out.
Cere was always brave. And stubborn.
Cere won her battle with the dark side.
Cere would be disappointed if I left you to die in the desert.
Cere would've really liked ya, sweetheart.
Cere!
Cere!
Cere!
Cere!
Cere!
Cere! Cere!
Cere!? No, Cere!
Cere's built her archive in quite the hidden fortress.
Cere's dead 'cause of you.
Cere's hallikset.
Cere's hurt!
Cere's still got a few lessons for us, huh buddy?
Cere,
Cere, are the Anchorites really coming with us?
Cere, do you hear me?
Cere, don't know if you can hear me, but I'm sure gonna miss you.
Cere, look!
Cere, me, Cal, the space witch - wait, did he mention the space witch?
Cere, no!
Cere, stuck in the past. Merrin, wandering.
Cere, watch out!
Cere, we must go!
Cere.

Cordova said he found you while he was seeking other Jedi survivors.
Cordova said there were records of Dagan visiting a lab on this moon.
Cordova was a gentle soul. He deserved better.
Cordova will want to see this.
Cordova would be proud.

Corrosive spit? Ugh.
Coruscant is dangerous for us all. Be quick about your business.
Coruscant sounds amazing. All those machines, I'd love to go.
Coruscant's changed a lot over the last few years.
Coruscant's fun, but it has a way of making you feel insignificant.
Coruscant's not so bad...when you're not being shot at.
Coruscant. We sure about this?
Cough, cough, Dagan Gera.
Could I interest you in a tale?
Could I take a drink from your canteen? Mine's empty.
Could Khri have meant Dagan?
Could be a good change.
Could be a good look.
Could be a good place to lay low.
Could be a lack of focus.
Could be a shortcut. Wanna check it out, buddy?
Could be a trap.
Could be a way in.
Could be danger anywhere. Anywhere!
Could be great for you.
Could be one of those meditation chambers.
Could be the dust in the air. Imperial patrols probably don't help either.
Could be underneath us.
Could be useful in the garden.
Could be what makes 'em dangerous.
Could be with the senator.
Could be worth checking out.
Could be. But if they did, they wouldn't live to regret it.
Could be. Command's on high alert. Lotta chatter on Raider's comms.
Could check out this meditation chamber if we'd like.
Could give us a fighting chance against the Empire.
Could it still be active?
Could liven up the place. Let us make haste, Tulli Mu!
Could mean there's a hostile taking out patrols.
Could probably do with getting you a good service one of these days. You know, the works!
Could say that about a lot of folks who frequent Pyloon's.
Could the same not apply to those who trod the sands before us?
Could us a little help, BD.
Could use some help, buddy.
Could use some more salt.
Could use this.
Could you at least try and act disciplined?
Could you clear this up?
Could you go away?
Could you wire it up? I've got an idea.
Could you...move this along?
Could've used that luck when we were hunting for the holocron.
Couldn't a Jedi easily sneak past our defenses?
Couldn't find a way to the turbolift.
Couldn't get away. 
Couldn't handle the fight?

Couldn't hurt, I guess.
Couldn't make heads or tails of it.
Couldn't resist, could you?
Couldn't see this one.

Dagan Gera arrived on the first shuttle this morning.
Dagan Gera feels he must do what is right.
Dagan Gera had the last compass, but it's -
Dagan Gera has belief.
Dagan Gera refused and rebelled against The Order.
Dagan Gera stands in your way.
Dagan Gera was the only person to live through what we're about to do.
Dagan Gera will build a new galaxy atop your broken remains!
Dagan Gera.
Dagan Gera. Rayvis serves him.
Dagan abandoned the Jedi Code. Now look at him.
Dagan and Santari Khri planned their future here.
Dagan blames the Jedi for his injury and imprisonment and is pleased when Cal tells him the Order has been destroyed. 
Dagan could be anywhere. Ready, BD?
Dagan faced Jedi here. Killed them, without hesitation.
Dagan felt like his life's work was being threatened.
Dagan has granted me this chance, I will not waste it!
Dagan intends to reclaim it.
Dagan is arming Raiders with lightsabers?
Dagan may already have the compass.
Dagan may be delusional, but he's got an army that believes in him.
Dagan must be sending them out for something.
Dagan must think she can lead him to a compass.
Dagan must've sent Rayvis to get the compass. Maybe the Forest Array powers something on the moon.
Dagan ordered Rayvis to the moon, mentioned the last compass.
Dagan sent Rayvis to check out another array on the moon. Maybe we'll find it there.
Dagan sent one of his lieutenants there.
Dagan sent them. He's after Tanalorr.
Dagan stood right there when he saw invaders arrive. He would've fought to the death to protect this place.
Dagan's Retreat
Dagan's going to destroy Zee to get what he wants. He's obsessed.
Dagan's gone.
Dagan's in my head.
Dagan's throwing everything he has at us, huh?
Dagan's vision is our vision. Rayvis is his right hand.
Dagan, his army. Those were long odds, even for you.
Dagan, listen. The Jedi is a threat.
Dagan, wait.

Does this mean you're a Jedi?
Does this meet your approval?
Doesn't change things for me: empty pockets, empty spot beside me...
Doesn't feel like syndicate work. Security feeds glitching. Hangar launch protocols. Alarm systems.
Doesn't feel right, being here.
Doesn't help, does it?
Doesn't hurt to have the Empire and the raiders at each other's throats.
Doesn't it just...
Doesn't look like there were any survivors.
Doesn't look like they've modified the design too much.
Doesn't look like they've spotted us yet.
Doesn't look like this gate is working.
Doesn't matter how far you fly, the Empire can always hear you.
Doesn't matter now. Saw Gerrera will find a use for you.
Doesn't matter!
Doesn't matter. I'll still win. 
Doesn't matter. We'll beat whatever he's got.
Doesn't need it anymore.
Doesn't sound good.
Doesn't sound like the easiest place to grow up.
Doesn't sound like the kind of relationship that lasts.
Doesn't sound worth it.
Doesn't surprise me. Rations at this posting are terrible.
Doesn't that get a little dull?
Doin' another sweep.
Doin' good, Greez?
Doing a pretty bad job so far.
Doing alright up there, friend?
Doing alright, BD?
Doing alright, girl?
Doing alright?
Doing another sweep.
Doing my best!
Doing okay, Greez?
Doing okay, big friend?
Doing okay, friend?
Doing some scouting today.
Doma better start investing in urban planning.
Doma looked at the first wild-eyed hooligans on Koboh an' saw hard workers.
Doma said she had something for you at her shop!
Doma says, 'No way. I'll meet with 'em, and we'll do this right.' We all think she's crazy, mind.
Doma's got the best goods in town.
Doma, more like 'Go-Home-A'!
Domination!
Don't back down!
Don't back down, its only a laser sword.
Don't be a fool. Keep focus.
Don't be a fool. Once he gets what he's after, he'll cut you loose with the rest of us.
Don't be a stranger.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be his next target!
Don't be naive!
Don't be naive, buddy. It ain't doin' anybody any good in the hands of some historian.
Don't be next!
Don't be next!
Don't be next.
Don't be reckless!
Don't be reckless, trooper. Whatever is out there has already proven itself capable.
Don't be reckless.
Don't be scared, Kestis.
Don't be so predictable.
Don't be such a coward.
Don't beat yourself up. We're all figuring things out day by day.
Don't blame me!
Don't bore me.
Don't bother squaring up, stay light on your feet and you'll dance around that rust bucket.
Don't bother, Grock. There are sayers, and there are doers.
Don't bother, I handled it already.
Don't bother.
Don't call me that.
Don't care much for these critters.
Don't challenge a Jedi Master!
Don't come home.
Don't count on it, scummer.
Don't cross the Brood. 
Don't die just yet. This is fun.
Don't die on me, Jedi.
Don't die on me, we're almost there!
Don't die on me.
Don't die yet!
Don't die yet, Jedi!
Don't disappoint me!
Don't disappoint me!
Don't disappoint me.
Don't do anything stupid, yeah? Not when we need to survive some Jedi.
Don't do thaaat!
Don't drop your blaster.
Don't fall behind!
Don't fall behind!
Don't fall behind, BD-1.
Don't fall down!
Don't fall now. 
Don't fall yet!

Don't fall!
Don't fall.
Don't falter. 
Don't fear that Jedi or that weapon.
Don't fear the Force.
Don't follow too closely.
Don't forget Pyloon's Saloon. Greez is the owner.
Don't forget about that shattered moon. Cordova seems to think it was important.
Don't forget the KX droids.
Don't forget their lives are terrible.
Don't forget to talk to DeeDee if you wanna switch songs.
Don't forget what Sister Taske says: behind every good archive is a good filing system.
Don't forget! Other opponents are still itching for a match.
Don't get a lot of passengers, friend?
Don't get back up. Don't get back up. 
Don't get blown up!
Don't get careless.
Don't get careless.

Don't get hit. 
Don't get in my way, or I'll fight you too.
Don't get knocked around.
Don't get me wrong, I trust you both, but I knew you'd be taking her to some dangerous places.
Don't get me wrong, I used to adore Coruscant. But all that neon. It's a bit harsh on the eyes.
Don't get much activity anymore, though. Not since...
Don't get near him!
Don't get pushed around!
Don't get rattled. Carry on.
Don't get sloppy.
Don't get smart with me.
Don't get too close to its spikes.
Don't get too close to them.

Don't get too used to it. You know how I am.
Don't give any ground!
Don't give him an opening!
Don't give him any space!
Don't give in to him. 
Don't give up yet!
Don't give up yet.
Don't give up!
Don't go getting into more trouble, alright?
Don't go waking up any more vulture droids, you hear?
Don't have the skill or inclination.
Don't have time for you.
Don't have time to mope with you right now.
Don't have time.
Don't have to be rude about it.
Don't have to worry about those ranged units.
Don't have too many people like that in my life, but that probably says more about me than you.
Don't hesitate, aim, fire. I will!
Don't hide underneath me.
Don't hold a grudge, Cal. It's not you.
Don't hold back, Jedi.
Don't hurt her!
Don't hurt him, Papa!
Don't hurt him. He could be useful to us.
Don't hurt yaself.
Don't impede my attack.
Don't insult me.
Don't interfere. 
Don't judge.
Don't just sit there. Evade his shots!
Don't just stand there!
Don't just stand there!
Don't just stand there! Do something!
Don't just watch this happen again!
Don't keep wasting my time.
Don't kill me!
Don't know how they pulled that off.
Don't know how you survived.
Don't know what that stuff is but...it definitely doesn't look safe.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Don't know why they were flying in such poor conditions. Wanna check it out?
Don't know ya, don't like ya.
Don't know, don't care.
Don't know. But if we can use it to stop the Empire, it'll all be worth it.

Don't needs more trouble.

Don't take too long. That beast is a menace.
Don't talk about Bracca.
Don't tell Greez, but he's right about this moon. Creepy.

Don't tell me that kid didn't even mention me?
Don't tell me what to do!
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me you cut a deal with him.
Don't tell me you tried to mount him?

Don't they know droids are superior?
Don't they know that fishies need sunlight tae grow ruddy an' strong?
Don't they know what we're dealing with?
Don't they see the bigger picture?
Don't think I can call the lift from here.
Don't think I have.
Don't think I want to get too close.
Don't think I'll be able to move it.

Don't wait, or you might miss your chance.
Don't wanna fight?
Don't want a real fight?
Don't want to wake the dead.
Don't want to wake the dead...again.
Don't waste my time!
Don't waste my time. 
Don't waste your time!
Don't worry - I doubt there'll be tales of battle droid heroism.
Don't worry Cal. You handle the mystery in the forest, I'll handle Greez.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it. Thanks for having my back.
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. But we must find my datapad!
Don't worry about things here, Cal.
Don't worry, Cal. I will protect you.
Don't worry, I will do my best to unlock what secrets these devices hold.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.
Don't worry, friend, I'm certain there are more opponents just waiting out there!
Don't worry, we won't be so careless.
Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll find him.
Don't worry. I'll find you.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.
Don't worry. I'm tougher than that.
Don't worry. I've heard worse.
Don't worry. That thing's as sturdy as a bantha.
Don't you dare try to direct me to do spit, you hear me?
Don't you dare.
Don't you ever miss your home?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Don't you got stuff to do?
Don't you have a mountain to climb?
Don't you lay a hand on my rifle.
Don't you mind, Cal. Real friends like you got nothin' to worry about.
Don't you run!
Don't you run!
Don't you see?
Don't you want to see Cere's Archive?
Don't you worry about this place, Cal. I have everything under control.
Don't you worry, by the time those arrays are activated, I'll have the Mantis in top condition.
Don't!
Don't, I beg you. I fought in the war.
Don't, Papa! You'll kill him!
Don't. Ever. Criticize me.
Don't... let him run!
Done and done.
Done and dusted.
Done for now, eh? Well, there's still more to take down when you're back!
Done playing Sorc Tormo for the day?
Done running?
Done with that.
Done.
Doooo!
Doosa! Bako di!
Doosi way! 
Double or nothin'!
Doubt Cere expected me to use it like that.
Down goes the Jedi.
Down here, though? I guess there's some decent stuff. Can't beat a Turbo Dog.
Down one destroyer droid.
Down there!
Down there!
Down there, Cal. Think it's worth a look?

Dreamers like her - a whole bloody community.
Drearily legitimate.

Due to heightened security, this hangar is restricted.
Duh-nuh duh-nuh bwwwoooooo!
Dull tricks.
Dum, dum, da-dum.
Dunno if you heard, Cal, but Grock and I just made a big ol' score out in Dredger Gorge.
Dust inducing painful reactions. Possibly...fatal!?
Dusty and abandoned.
Duty calls.
Each and every droid is a rung on the ladder of victory.
Each array activated the next. Dagan was right about Santari.
Each bell represents someone who passed away on their pilgrimage.
Eager to serve the Empire!
Eager to slaughter organics?
Early attempts to navigate the Abyss ended in disaster.

Eh, I think he's sorta attached to me.
Eh, I'll take my chances. Unless...
Eh, I've got this. 
Eh, bodyguards get paid.
Eh, is it?
Eh, it's just a big bug.
Eh, it's not half bad around here...
Eh, it's not so tough.

Eh, let's not think about that one too hard.
Eh, no. But fishing's about leavin' the world better than ye found it.
Eh, nothing.
Eh, say what you will about the Haxion Brood, but they don't lack personality.
Eh, that's nothing. 
Eh, there's a few raider-free pockets left, but Koboh ain't what it used to be.
Eh, they aim and they shoot. Sometimes, they even hit their targets.
Eh, they deserved that. 
Eh, they were just in my way.
Eh, they were just in my way.
Eh, this ain't my fight.
Eh, this is nothing.

Even if you believe the council betrayed you,
Even if you did wear the 'you know what' card on your sleeve, I highly doubt anyone around here would care.
Even if you yourself have forgotten...
Even in my day, there were those who wrapped their selfish ambitions in the cloak of higher purpose.
Even one with your tactical acumen has to stay sharp.
Even rancors will fall to the Raiders!

Every one of us is at the Empire's command.
Every plant bears a secret.

Every time I think we're safe, the Empire shows up.
Every time I travel this desert, I see something new.
Every time they smash things up, I'm the one who's gotta fix 'em.
Every time we're here, I have my doubts we'll survive.
Everybody focus your fire on it!
Everybody loves Monk, but if you ask me, he talks too much.
Everybody open fire!
Everybody's got rockets except me.
Everyone at this outpost has a unique...energy. Take Doma, for example. Strong, like a boulder.
Everyone has a plan, until blaster bolts whizz past their face.
Everyone holding up okay, Monk?
Everyone is excited about by the possibility of what Koboh could become.
Everyone is gone.
Everyone!
Everyone! Fire on the enemy!
Everyone's afraid, and there's nothing I can do about it.
Everyone's bent outta shape now that the Imperials are here to stay.
Everyone's got a weakness, and Sorc's is obsession. He fell for someone once, long ago. Lover-boy used to sing to him.
Everyone's trying to steal my cache.
Everything I'm doing feels pointless.
Everything Khri built here was destroyed by a catastrophe she couldn't foresee.
Everything burns!
Everything burns, in the end.
Everything has a price. You'll see.
Everything is at risk so long as the Empire is around.

Exactly! Said they could get me some gigs in the Core.
Exactly! So fascinating.
Exactly! The anticipation is killing me. But I've been giving it a real hard think, and I finally know what I want.
Exactly! They can't stand up to hardened machines like us!
Exactly! Very insightful, for once. For guardians of peace, they did an awful lot of makin' war.
Exactly! You can't eat 'em. Can't skin them. Can't even trade with them.
Exactly, can't vaporize traitor rats without the muscle to back it up.
Exactly.

From that day forward, when I plunged ma line into the frigid waters...
From the eye of the storm into the belly of the beast you must go.
From this distance, I should have an easy shot on the Jedi.
From time to time. There are quite a few things I miss.
From what I can tell, you don't either.
From what I hear, he was a Jedi sympathizer.
From what I understand, the Jedi can manipulate the thoughts of others to do their bidding!
From who? Rayvis or the other one?
Frozen in carbonite!

Giving up, I guess. Fine with me. 
Glad that thing's dead.
Glad that's over.
Glad that's over. We should stick together more often.
Glad to hear it, Zee.
Glad to hear someone's not letting the Empire scare them away, but you need to be careful up there.
Glad to hear the Mantis is up and runnin' again.
Glad to see that nasty thing go.
Glad we could clear this place of the Empire.
Glad we found this before the Empire could.
Glad you asked! When I was a captain, I named it the Stinger Mantis to show how tough we were.
Glad you came around to it.
Glad you came to Koboh, Cal. You're a hard worker, aren't ya? And always putting others before yourself.
Glad you didn't have to fly through that storm. So, how's it feel to be piloting the Mantis again?
Glad you made it back in one piece.
Glad you noticed.
Glad you stopped by.
Glad you were able to clear that building full of roller mines. Whole thing was a powder keg.
Glad you're excited.
Glad you're here, Bode.
Glad you're on my side.
Glad you're onboard, Merrin.
Glad your back. 
Gladly.

Go shut 'em up, will ya? They're a disgrace to the profession if you ask me.
Go stick that crap in the jukebox, will ya? I mean, seriously. I ain't gonna let this bleed me.
Go through quickly. It will protect you.
Go time.

Good - stay alert.
Good advice, Monk. I'll try to follow it.
Good aim!

Good shot, Cal.
Good shot.
Good spamel!
Good spamel.
Good spot to grow.
Good talk.
Good texture on this.
Good thing he's making an exception for us.
Good thing she didn't throw you out.
Good thing they're not trained to use the Force.
Good thing, too. If they hadn't, there might not be any leads to chase.
Good thinking, BD. But it's no use from this side.
Good thinking, BD. See you on the other side.
Good time as any to modify.
Good time to review our gear.
Good tip.
Good to go, BD! Let's try that again.
Good to go.
Good to hear! Say, you might want to talk to Zee.
Good to hear. You doing alright?
Good to know some things never change.

Good to see ya, Cal.
Good to see you Cal.
Good to see you in one piece.
Good to see you landed on your feet, Cal.
Good to see you made it back. How's Pyloon's treating you?
Good to see you!
Good to see you!
Good to see you, young Jedi!
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Good to see you. Maybe explore Koboh for a fresh face and a fresh challenge?

Good! Don't fall yet!
Good! I will have every last drop of fight from you!
Good! Yes, leave! There is much to do.
Good, Cere!
Good, Cere!
Good, I got a feeling you're gonna need it.
Good, I want to feel something.
Good, he killed it. Oh wait.
Good, it's time to finish this.
Good, jetpack doesn't have enough juice to carry us both.
Good, no more distractions.
Good, thanks.
Good, that's good.
Good, that's...great. If you see the Jedi, then, get right in there. Don't let anyone beat you to victory!
Good, thinking about whipping some curried burrah fish.
Good, time to hunt some Jedi.
Good, we will put that dedication to the test.
Good, we'll need them.
Good, wear them down.
Good, you're following my orders.
Good, you're... right where I want you.

Good. But I am a witch.
Good. Cordova will be glad to hear it.
Good. Hate to see somethin' happen to ya, the goin's just startin' to get good, Cal.
Good. If you did, we're scrapped.
Good. Keep it that way.
Good. Let us proceed.
Good. More fight for me.
Good. Now, for whatever reason, Doma doesn't want to see you go belly-up.
Good. Perhaps your business here will soon be concluded.
Good. Soon, you will serve a new master...
Good. That stuff's toxic.
Good. The Empire wants results. Let's deliver.
Good. Then they don't know about the safe house.
Good. They are much less prone to premature detonation.
Good. They must never learn that the Path was here.
Good. They were just in the way.
Good. Two kills in one, then.
Good. Very good.
Good. We should hurry, Cal. A storm is coming.
Good. We'll see if he's got connections to the usuals.
Good. When the heavy armor arrives, we'll know the Imps mean business.
Good. When they're bothered, they're easier to kill.
Goodbye, detonator!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbyeeee!
Goodness. Sorry, droideka.

Greetin's!
Greetin's.
Greetings, newcomer.
Greetings, noble one. Are you finding your way?
Greetings, sojourner.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings. I am Senator Daho Sejan. I represent Utapau.
Greez Dritus doesn't make things up. Never. Not even once!
Greez Dritus don't need no babysitter!
Greez Dritus, this is Bode Akuna. He was on Coruscant.
Greez also signs on as their pilot, motivated by the prospect of bringing the old crew back together.
Greez always had a green thumb. You know he talks to his plants?
Greez always had an eye for eccentric art.
Greez always kept a few secrets up his sleeve.
Greez and the others are still waiting for you at the landing pad, you know.
Greez asked Cere about her once. I think he had a crush.
Greez ever tell you the story of how we met?
Greez gets anxious around dirt.
Greez has been down in the basement ever since you came back. Is he alright?
Greez has told me some real tales about that thing.
Greez informed me you were in need of assistance so here I am!
Greez is a little shaky in the cockpit.
Greez is fired up and ready to answer the call.
Greez is going to love this.
Greez is going to teach me to cook.
Greez is gonna be surprised to see us, huh?
Greez is right. This planet is dangerous, especially down here. We must be careful.
Greez must be in the kitchen. We'll meet up with him later.
Greez opens a hidden door in his closet that leads to some abandoned smuggler tunnels.
Greez really outdid himself.
Greez said the moon was destroyed by a rock. Is that true?
Greez sure picked an interesting place to live.
Greez tells Cal he has a stash down there - including a spare GYRO CONTROL MODULE for the Mantis.
Greez told you this?
Greez won't say it, but he missed you.
Greez's kitchen.
Greez's place should be around here somewhere...
Greez's standards might be the undoing of this place: build a business only you can run, and you're inviting disaster.
Greez, are you alright?
Greez, can I fly the Mantis?
Greez, did I hear you mention curried burrah fish?
Greez, do you hear me?
Greez, have you been telling stories about me?
Greez, not sure I'll ever meet another Latero like him.
Greez, really?!
Greez, the seats on the Mantis...
Greez, unless one of us is gonna stay behind, we need someone here to activate the arrays.
Greez, what are you doing?
Greez, why did we have to come back here?
Greez, why's it called the Mantis?
Greez, you should know...when my old crew worked from the Mantis, we made a few changes.
Greez, you there?
Greez. Ya know, I heard the Haxion Brood wants him dead.
Greez? Well shoot I know him. I run the stables in town. My name's Mosey.
Greezy Money strikes again!
Greezy does it, baby!
Greezy-money!

Guess I'm all that's left.
Guess I'm fine too.
Guess I'm on my own...
Guess I'm picking up the scrap today.
Guess I'm stuck looking for trouble.
Guess Sorc should have warned you.
Guess hardshells aren't so tough...
Guess he couldn't handle me.
Guess he got the message a few years too late.
Guess he got what was coming to him.
Guess he's just gone?
Guess it's a ranged fight now?
Guess it's all close range now...
Guess it's just you and me. 
Guess it's my turn to check.
Guess it's quitting time for this guy. 
Guess it's time to get in close.
Guess it's you and me.
Guess it's you and me. 
Guess nobody told them General Grievous is long gone...
Guess not. How'd you and Mosey get along?
Guess so. Everyone has to do their part.
Guess someone does live here. Or did once.
Guess that was Golden Skriton Sister Taske was talking about.
Guess the Empire got rid of them, too. How can this keep happening?
Guess the bounty is all mine.
Guess the jig was up.
Guess the platform isn't here.
Guess they should have been more careful.
Guess this is goodbye, huh?
Guess we found the party.
Guess we got a live audience, BD.
Guess we got more in common that I thought.
Guess we need to move in...
Guess we should go back on patrol...
Guess we're doing this.
Guess we're friends now, huh?
Guess we're heading out then! You ready?
Guess we're out of heavy support.
Guess we've got more in common than I thought.
Guess who's not coming.
Guess you and Grock weren't so close, huh?
Guess you and Grock weren't so close, huh?
Guess you can't put a price on sanctuary.
Guess you were right about the Empire all along, Moran.
Guess you'll see back at base. 
Guessing it was the same with you.
Guests. They're watching us.
Guh!

Gyaah!
Gyaah!
Gyahhhh.
Gyro control module is failing. Where's Greez when you need him?
Gyro's burnt out on the Mantis. We'll need your help to get moving again.
Gyro's failing!
Gyro's failing, we'll never make it to Greez like this; I have to put her down.
Gyuhhh, guh...

Here I go! Holdin' ma breath in three, two, one - ! [Massive inhale]
Here I go.
Here I go. 
Here I thought you were all straight-edges and well-coifed hair.
Here I was, trying to help.
Here and there.
Here and there. Spent a lot of my life on Birren. That's where Kata was born. Ever been?
Here at the galactic frontier.
Here comes a grenade. 
Here comes a shiverpede!
Here comes the end!
Here comes the pain!
Here comes trouble!
Here for the soundscape, too?
Here goes nothing!
Here he comes!
Here he is, the undisputed champion.
Here it comes!

Here's hoping it lasts.
Here's hoping!
Here's sand in your eye.
Here's some fire.
Here's some force for ya.

Here's the kicker, though. This creature had tentacles too. Don't remember the name of it, but it was mean!
Here's the kicker.
Here's the meditation chamber Toa mentioned.
Here's ya party trick.
Here's ya party trick.
Here's your new home.

Here, you will learn to harness Koboh matter in order to prepare yourself to traverse the Abyss.
Here.
Here.
Here. A hardshell
Here. Catch.
Here. Our mark. 
Heresy! My purpose here is far beyond petty larceny.
Heritage ran outta here in a hurry. Have anything to do with those lights in the sky?
Heritage, you're looking low on power. What say we pause a tic so you can regain your bearings?
Heroes shouldn't play bounty hunter.
Hey - stop that now!
Hey - watch it!
Hey BD.
Hey BD.
Hey Bode, can you get that for me?
Hey Cal! You notice any new changes?
Hey Cal, check the holoprojector. We got a call from Jedha.
Hey Cal, did you hear those vulture droids screamin' around the mountain?
Hey Cal, good to see you.
Hey Cal, got some info that might be useful to you.
Hey Cal, hold up.
Hey Cal, if you die I get the Mantis, right?
Hey Cal, let's talk another time - mind's racing with ideas right now.
Hey Cal, lotta chatter on comms. You okay?
Hey Cal, where's your buddy at?
Hey Cal, would you like to buy my 'Guide to Koboh'?
Hey Cal, you there?
Hey Cal, you're pretty familiar with Rambler's Reach, right?
Hey Cal.
Hey Cal. Why don't you relax a little before we fix the Mantis? The galaxy can wait a couple hours!
Hey Cere.
Hey Dana. Grock.
Hey Gabs, thanks for the -
Hey Greez, you alright?
Hey Greez.
Hey Greez. Know where Kata is?
Hey I also hear there's a decent diner over in CoCo Town, but I've never been.
Hey Kata.
Hey Monk!
Hey Monk, I'm not sure if I said this yet, and if I have I probably haven't said it enough, but thanks.
Hey Monk, any sign of the Raiders?
Hey Monk, did you remember to charge the hydro converters?
Hey Monk, now that I'm not gonna be around as much, we should talk about Pyloon's.
Hey Monk, you smelling what I'm smelling?
Hey Monk.
Hey Monk.
Hey Monk. Where'd you and Greez meet?
Hey Moran.
Hey Toa. You mentioned things were changing at the academy before you left.
Hey Tulakt.
Hey Zygg, looks like you found some company up here.
Hey back. I heard there was someone collecting samples up here. 
Hey boss, do you think we've got a shot at negotiating with the Bedlam Raiders over a couple of drinks?
Hey bright spark!
Hey bud! Stim!
Hey buddy!
Hey buddy.
Hey buddy.
Hey buddy.
Hey does anybody else smell something burning?
Hey down there!
Hey everyone, I have an announcement, I found a...no, nevermind. Forgot I said anything!
Hey fellas, how long have you been together?
Hey hunter, the Haxion's bloodhound, Vaslyn Martz, has been sniffing around for you on the mountain.
Hey it needs that!
Hey kid, I got some bad news on our favorite Ordo Eris fanatic.
Hey kid. Hurry back.
Hey look at that, he ain't dead, how you doin' kid?
Hey noooo!
Hey now!
Hey now, my droid!
Hey sport. Can't chat now.
Hey there buddy.
Hey there traveler, you shut down that Bedlam Raider warehouse yet?
Hey there!
Hey there!
Hey there!
Hey there!
Hey there, Mosey. You stop into Pyloon's often?
Hey there, big tail.
Hey there, boy.
Hey there, friend.
Hey there, friend.
Hey there, remember me?
Hey there, sport. Care for any refreshment?
Hey there.
Hey there.
Hey there.
Hey up there!
Hey who's that?
Hey you!
Hey you! Stop!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! 
Hey! Aahhh!
Hey! An enemy!
Hey! An intruder!
Hey! BD. Let's go!
Hey! Come down here!
Hey! Come down!
Hey! Come here!
Hey! Come here!
Hey! Come here!
Hey! Come over here. 
Hey! Did you see that?
Hey! Get out here!
Hey! Get over here!
Hey! Gorocco here!
Hey! He owed me credits!
Hey! He's above us!
Hey! He's down below!
Hey! He's down below!
Hey! He's down there!
Hey! He's down there!
Hey! Heard you made the trip to that Jawa village. That must've been amazing.
Hey! Hey!? What the...
Hey! I give the orders.
Hey! I needed those!
Hey! I'm a bird watcher too! Tons of birds on Lateron.
Hey! Intruder!
Hey! Look!
Hey! Nice work stopping that gorocco!
Hey! No fair!
Hey! Our bounty!
Hey! Put that back!
Hey! Remember why you're here, and do your duty, as-ordered.
Hey! Stop that.
Hey! The Jedi!
Hey! The twins are getting that ravenous look.
Hey! Watch this!
Hey! What have you found?
Hey! Who are you?
Hey! Who's that?
Hey! Who's that?
Hey! Who's that?
Hey! Who's there?
Hey! Who's there?
Hey! Who's there?!
Hey! You there!
Hey! You!
Hey! You!
Hey! You!
Hey! You!
Hey! You! Come here!
Hey! You! Identify yourself!
Hey! it's him!
Hey! it's him!
Hey,
Hey, BD!
Hey, BD!
Hey, BD-1!
Hey, BD-1!
Hey, BD-1.
Hey, BD. A little help?
Hey, BD?
Hey, Bode. How many backup blasters do you got? Y'know, in case an energy cell goes dark? I bet this guy's got dozens.
Hey, Bravo!
Hey, Cal.
Hey, Cal. I tried to move those beams, but -
Hey, Cal. Over here.
Hey, Cal. We've been wondering something.
Hey, Cal. You got a sec?
Hey, Cal?
Hey, Cere or Master Cordova's got the answers, not me. Talk to one of them.
Hey, Cere.
Hey, Dana. Suppose we do make off with that fuel injector.
Hey, I can take care of myself.
Hey, I get it. I'm a bit hard to work with, but you really lived up to the name of this place.
Hey, I hit him.
Hey, I hope you're not downloading non-work files on the patrol.
Hey, I want a cut of that.
Hey, I was just workin' on that droid!
Hey, I was right about the Witch planet! It was bad to the core - there were zombies, Cal, remember!
Hey, I was thinking. Now that Merrin's back in the crew, we could always head to Coruscant. Not that I want to...
Hey, I'll tell ya what. We'll cook every recipe in the book. That'll jog my memory.
Hey, I've been mulling over what you said about the future of Koboh.
Hey, I've seen you around. Don't reckon we've been introduced. I'm Dana.
Hey, Jedi! Time to fight me!
Hey, Kata. I'll be home soon. I'm bringing you something nice. I can't wait to see you. 
Hey, Merrin!
Hey, Merrin, you hear that?
Hey, Monk - let's get the music goin' again, eh?
Hey, Monk keeps this place running.
Hey, Monk! What's it take for a frog with blood on his hands to get some service around here? [crying]
Hey, Moran!
Hey, Moran. What do you think about that moon beam hitting the mountain?
Hey, Skoova.
Hey, Skoova. How's the water?
Hey, Toa.
Hey, Turgle.
Hey, Turgle.
Hey, Zee. I heard Monk brought you up to speed on recent events.
Hey, Zee. Know anything about that Forest Array?
Hey, Zygg. What's going on?
Hey, bacta breath.
Hey, boss. When you bought the saloon you inspected it, right?
Hey, bring me back a Turbo Dog if you get the chance. Only decent thing on this shiny rock.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy. Hiya Cal.
Hey, buddy. Stim?
Hey, buddy?
Hey, c'mon, easy now!
Hey, check this out.
Hey, clankers!
Hey, come here!
Hey, didn't expect to see you so soon.
Hey, do you see that?
Hey, don't be. Happens to all of us, right? Old man even got the payload out before he...
Hey, don't get mushy on me. Do I miss Grock? Sure I do.
Hey, don't worry about it.
Hey, down there!
Hey, gimme some space. I'm in the middle of visualizing new decor for the cantina.
Hey, girl.
Hey, glad you both found Pyloon's alright.
Hey, good shot.
Hey, got a proposition for ya.
Hey, got a sec?
Hey, got no more close-range guys!
Hey, great pep talk kids.
Hey, hands off!
Hey, have you ever been to the canyon lift?
Hey, have you ever set eyes on the canyon lift?
Hey, he's firing back!
Hey, he's up there!
Hey, hey stop!
Hey, how 'bout you save the jokes for later, Jetpack?
Hey, how come you never charge me for our chats? You make everyone else pay for your wisdom.
Hey, how do you think I feel?
Hey, if you got time grab me a Turbo Dog on your way back to the Mantis.
Hey, is that our friend from the Forest Array?
Hey, it was great meetin' ya, Cal. Got some business to discuss with my old pal, here.
Hey, it's nice to see you too.
Hey, it's our mark!
Hey, it's our mark!
Hey, let me know if you find any more of those chambers, yeah?
Hey, let's do something.
Hey, listen?
Hey, little guy.
Hey, look at the tracking chops on you. Natural born hunter.
Hey, look at this.
Hey, mate.
Hey, my credits!
Hey, my helmet was fogged up last night! On account of the... the fog.
Hey, my shield!
Hey, new seeds. Better bring this back to Pili and the garden.
Hey, no fair!
Hey, no fair!
Hey, no givin' up hope on my ship!
Hey, no!
Hey, nobody's perfect!
Hey, not bad.
Hey, now!
Hey, now!
Hey, put that down.
Hey, rough trick.
Hey, save some for me!
Hey, seeds! We should try planting these back in the garden.
Hey, seeds! We'll plant them and ask Pili about them.
Hey, slow down!
Hey, someone's in a good mood.
Hey, stay here!
Hey, stay there.
Hey, stay there.
Hey, stop that!
Hey, stop that!
Hey, stop that!
Hey, stop that.
Hey, stormtrooper. Snap out of it. 
Hey, that goes for both of us, kid.
Hey, that wasn't a dig.
Hey, that's a Bilemaw!
Hey, that's not bad.
Hey, that's not very Jedi!
Hey, the destroyer droid!
Hey, there's a Skriton here!
Hey, this entrance didn't pop up on any environmental scanners.
Hey, this is a good find.
Hey, this stuff is not ancient! Hell, we're still using relays from the rimward expansions!
Hey, uh, watch your step down there, be careful. I definitely have a pest problem.
Hey, wait a minute Cere, does that mean you're coming?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, watch it!
Hey, watch this one.
Hey, what am I? Raw scazz steak?
Hey, what happened to the Mantis?
Hey, what's that?
Hey, what's that?
Hey, whatever happened to ol' Kagh'rell?
Hey, when you're the galaxy's most wanted, you might as well go out in style.
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, where's that blaster-strapped buddy of yours?
Hey, where's--?
Hey, while you're out there, if you find anyone seeking a capable, homegrown handy-lady, you send 'em my way.
Hey, who's over there?
Hey, working hard?
Hey, you got a favorite color?
Hey, you heard about that local who won't come out of his house?
Hey, you remember that time Cere tried to make that Devaronian dish?
Hey, you wanna do me a favor? Cut it out.
Hey, you wanted customers, right?
Hey, you! Come here. 
Hey, you're not supposed to be here!
Hey, you.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey. Come back. 
Hey. Come on out. 
Hey. How you doin'?
Hey. Identify yourself. 
Hey. It wasn't me.
Hey. Jedi's down there. 
Hey. Look down there. 
Hey. Look up there. 
Hey. Scrapper.
Hey. We're thinkin' of plugging fresh energy cores into the dams at Dredger Gorge. See if we can get 'em working again.
Hey. Yeah, you.
Hey...
Hey... boo!
Hey... you! Stop!
Hey...those new tools?
Heya!
Heya, Cal!
Heya, Cal. How you holding up?
Heya, fellas. I'm feeling a tad down. Cal, would ya mind if me and BD hung for a little while? 
Heya, fellas. Looking for us?
Hgh!

Hi Cal!
Hi Cal, here to ride more piasas?
Hi there!
Hi there.
Hi!
Hi, Cal. It's nice up here.
Hi, Pili.
Hi, boy.
Hi, ya troublemaker!
Hi.
Hidden in the ruins.
Hidden within the Koboh Abyss.
Hide all you want, it won't change anything!
Hide!
Hiding back there?
Hiding behind that door?
Hiding behind your saber?
Hiding down there?
Hiding is pure weakness.
Hiding won't save you!
Hiding? No, no. Just observing, that's what I do. Watch and wait.
High Republic datadisc. I bet Zee would have some use for it.
High Republic tech.
High five achieved.
High-value droid destroyed.
High-yield payload.
Higher ability than expected. 
Higher ground won't hide you.
Highly dangerous fauna approaching.
Highly irregular.

His lightsaber is dismantling that bodyguard unit.
His lightsaber is proving effective.
His lightsaber went right through it.

His weapon is dangerous.
His yacht's gone. You see it?
Historical B1 performance indicates otherwise. Check weapons systems.
Historically it has taken a large force to kill a Jedi...
Historically, they only send Purge Troopers to hunt down extreme threats to the Empire.
History? Like, legendary? I can believe that.
Hit 'em back!
Hit 'em buddy.
Hit 'em hard!
Hit 'em now!
Hit 'em quick!

Hiya!
Hiya!
Hiya, BD.
Hm, I guess I'm one of those folks who never gave it much thought.
Hm.
Hm.
Hm. A droid with its master.
Hm. Fine. That's a good reason, too.
Hm. I may need to revisit it.
Hm. I'm watching you.
Hm. Kinda startin' to like that lil' droid. Kinda.
Hm. Seems I've got a lot to learn.
Hm. That kind of loyalty is rare in this galaxy.
Hm? Oh. Yes, yes. Quite alright. I was just thinking about Dagan Gera.
Hmm, I don't have your name in my databanks. When did you pass the trials?
Hmm, I should charge double!
Hmm, all these variants would be great.
Hmm, give me a minute...
Hmm, good idea!
Hmm, maybe no one's there. Maybe. Maybe not. Well, go ahead and try me. I'm ready.
Hmm, might not be a bad call. Deedee swore one of those beasts gave him some side-eye.
Hmm, seeds. Let's plant them and ask Pili for info.
Hmm, tempting.
Hmm, there was a rare sub-species of a Poolia blossom that I found...quite stubborn.
Hmm, we'll need more seeds to get going, huh BD?
Hmm, what's best for this plant?
Hmm, where's my spatula?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm. Can't plant without seeds.
Hmm. I don't see a way up.
Hmm. Perhaps.
Hmm. The galaxy has changed.
Hmm. Yeah. I think I'm starting to get you.
Hmm. [sigh]
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm... got turned around somewhere.
Hmm...all the more for me, then.
Hmmm, where to?
Hmmm.
Hmmm. 
Hmmm. I think next...
Hmmm. What should I do?
Hmmm...
Hmmm...
Hmmmm. 
Hmmmm. 
Hmph!
Hmph!
Hmph, and you said we were friends.
Hmph, didn't see that coming.
Hmph, see ya.
Hmph, stim packs.
Hmph, stim packs.
Hmph, try that on me.
Hmph, you young'uns act weird.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph.
Hmph. A Jedi with no guts.
Hmph. Arrogance. No wonder you were all hunted to extinction.
Hmph. Each patrol is a noble duty handed down from Rayvis.
Hmph. Fine.
Hmph. I've always thought droids lack the creative impulse to succeed in business.
Hmph. It's unimportant. We will see Rayvis' will fulfilled.
Hmph. Lunatic.
Hmph. Lunatic.
Hmph. Lunatic.
Hmph. Rayvis sends us many places, and we obey.
Hmph. Rookie.
Hmph. Same to you.
Hmph. They think to stand against us?
Hmph. We'll see.
Hoh!
Hoh!
Hoh!
Hoh!
Hold fast, together!
Hold him back!
Hold it down, trooper. Once these winds die down, we'll pick back up on the main path.
Hold it right there! I won't let you through! I - I saw what you did to the others, Jedi scum!
Hold it right there.
Hold it!
Hold it! Come here!
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold on BD!
Hold on a second.
Hold on tight, BD!
Hold on tight, buddy!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on! [exertion]
Hold on, BD!
Hold on, buddy; it's a long drop!
Hold on, factory vents are overcharged, and no one ordered a Jedi extra crispy. 
Hold on, let me lower that exhaust tower.
Hold on, rookie. Let's take another look. 
Hold on, there's a factory vent that'll cook you medium rare.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on. 
Hold on. Give me that!
Hold on. I need cover. 
Hold position!
Hold position.
Hold position.
Hold position.
Hold steady, stormtroopers.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Hold still!
Hold still!
Hold still!
Hold still!
Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.
Hold the line!
Hold the line!
Hold the line.
Hold the line.
Hold the planet, defeat interlopers, obey the Raiders.
Hold them back! Lookout!
Hold them back! They cannot breach the Archive!
Hold them down!
Hold them here!
Hold up!
Hold up!
Hold up! Wait stop!
Hold your fire.
Hold your ground!
Hold your ground!
Hold your nerve, keep your aim, and we'll win the day.
Hold your position. Don't give ground to the Jedi. And don't embarrass me!
Hold yourself together and get on those comms.
Hold!
Hold!
Hold. Gunner down.
Hold. Movement. 
Holdin'!
Holding up okay, BD?
Holding up okay, boy?
Holding up okay?
Holding up okay?
Holding.
Holing up again, huh?
Holocrons?
Holopuck. Let's get this to Caij.
Holotactics!
Holotactics, huh.
Holy smokes, you've beaten them all.
Holy-!
Holy. Banthas.
Homes!?
Honestly, I don't blame you.
Hoo!
Hoo, that hurt?
Hooah!
Hooah!
Hop aboard Zee.
Hope Cere's got another way for these refugees, they've been through enough.
Hope Cordova can fix that compass.
Hope Greez has the parts we need.
Hope Greez is ready for a bumpy ride.
Hope Merrin can slow them down.
Hope is not a variable in my decision making.
Hope it does well over there.
Hope it hurts!
Hope not. But I'm always ready.
Hope our commanders saw this. 
Hope so.
Hope so.
Hope so.
Hope so.
Hope someone causes trouble. I'm ready for some action!
Hope someone didn't need that.
Hope that hurt.
Hope that's the last of the Haxion Brood we'll see.
Hope that's the last of them. Not a fan of long goodbyes.
Hope the crew's doing alright.
Hope they don't fire first, got it.
Hope they keep to themselves.
Hope this intel's worth the risk, Cal.
Hope this pans out.
Hope this works!
Hope this works.
Hope we didn't need BX droids.
Hope we're not too late. If Dagan gets off planet with the compass...
Hope will always survive in those who continue to fight.
Hope you weren't placing any bets.
Hope you're able to get Zee back. That old research droid really livens things up around here.
Hope you're better with that than the others.
Hope you're doing better than me!
Hope you're keeping safe.
Hope you're ready for a brawl. 
Hope you're ready for a rematch. The target could get here any minute.
Hope you're ready for some action. Looks like a big firefight up ahead.
Hope you're ready. 
Hope you're right.
Hope you're steady!
Hope you're steady!
Hope's something most of my clients are afraid to order, and impossible to serve in a bottle.
Hope.
Hopefully it's my mark.
Hopefully not.
Hopefully our armor's better than that.
Hopefully some enemies to kill?
Hopefully that Jedi doesn't get in the way.
Hopefully that'll be the last one.
Hopefully the Imperials and the Raiders finish each other off!
Hopefully they can fit that on my tombstone.

How 'bout a boost.
How 'bout that!
How 'bout that!
How 'bout that!
How 'bout that? We're both walking the same street with two different names.
How about Koboh? Heard it's nice. Also, kids - dinner's ready!
How about a bit of refreshment for bringing Zee back safe and sound? On the house, of course.
How about a toast, Tulakt?
How about another?
How about bottling Koboh matter and selling it as a miracle cure?
How about here?
How about putting a lock on the door so that slimy wretch won't wander back in?
How about that swamp? Almost lost a boot.
How about this one?
How about this then!?
How about this!
How about this!?
How about this.
How about this?
How about this?
How about this?
How about this?
How about this?!
How about we check out the terrain?
How about we give you a cut of any loot we find? Say, half of Grock's cut.
How about you cut the theatrics and let's get this over with?
How about you?
How am I supposed to fire around all that?
How am I supposed to hit him?
How am I supposed to lead if they keep getting destroyed?
How annoying.
How are we getting in?
How are we going to stop a Jedi anyway?
How are we honestly supposed to defeat a Jedi with just a blaster?
How are we meant to fight a Rancor!?
How are we still alive?
How are we supposed to control a planet without knowing about it?
How are we supposed to hit him?
How are we supposed to hit him?
How are we supposed to stop a Jedi?
How are we supposed to win without artillery?
How are you doing that?
How are you doing that?
How are you doing that?
How are you doing, girl?
How are you feeling, Zee?
How are you feeling?

How could Bode be a Jedi and be an Imperial spy?
How could I forget?
How could I not? Practically melted my membrane off.

How do you feel about the changes around here?
How do you figure we get that door open?

However you strike, I have the perfect counter.

However, I am programmed to be loyal.
Hrah!
Hrah!
Hrrgh.
Hsssss.
Huff!
Huff!
Huh I think something might be off with my blaster's calibrations
Huh!?
Huh, I guess Zee didn't forget.
Huh, I guess we're not so different.
Huh, a Jedi.
Huh, just like Zee's chamber.
Huh, that's strange...
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh. After all this, I thought I'd feel more. Ah well!
Huh. Figures. Koboh just can't catch a break.
Huh. Glad you're okay. What y'all doin' around these parts?
Huh. Good to know.
Huh. He ran away.
Huh. I think Kagh'rell used to say that.
Huh. I wasn't paying attention.
Huh. Might actually work.
Huh. Now what was that?
Huh. Okay that does make sense.
Huh. Sounds like you're on the hunt, then.
Huh. That was a Jedi?
Huh. That's different.
Huh. That's it?
Huh. This is different.
Huh. Well that's not good.

Huh? I mean...huh?
Huh? It wasn't my fault.
Huh? Me? No! Nah, that's Cal. Kid can't resist a helpless droid that'd get him into trouble.
Huh? Oh look, the Jedi!
Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. Somethin' like that.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Huh? Oh. Yes. Just planning my next move.
Huh? Was that...?
Huh? What's happening?
Huh? What?
Hullo, lad.
Hullo, laddie.
Humming. Organics seem to like it. Da-dum, dum.
Hundreds of years? Wow.
Hungry Klatooinians. We don't want that.
Hunk of junk!
Hunt him down!
Hunt protocol initiated.
Hunt protocol successful.
Hunt.
Hunted by the Empire like...
Hunted by the Empire, always on the run.
Hunting them down!
Hunting.
Hunting.
Hurry and blast him!
Hurry and kill him!
Hurry and kill him!
Hurry to that lab kid. I don't know what happened here and I don't wanna know!
Hurry up would you, Cal? Sitting under Imperial noses like this makes me nervous.
Hurry up, Cal.
Hurry up, I don't have all day.
Hurry up, buddy!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry! Before he escapes!
Hurry! Catch him!
Hurry! Catch him!

Hurtin'?
Hurting bad, Cal?
Hurting, Jedi?
Hurting, Jedi?
Hurting?
Hush, hush, little ones. We shall find you a new home soon enough.
Hush, now. This outpost is absolutely quaint. But, perhaps it could use a new coat of paint...
Hush. I'm tryna ask - say we make a bundle off this score.
Hush. We mustn't wake them. They need their rest. 
Hyaar!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hybridizing diverse genotypical specimens within novel macrocosmetic environments.
Hyeh!
I -
I - ! That's - !
I - I should have -
I Trust Monk
I Try Not To
I WILL find you.
I absolutely am. One hundred percent.
I actually crash-landed, so...my ship wouldn't fly.
I actually feel bad for you droids. You don't even get credits for this.
I actually got him. 
I admire that passion, but never get attached. Galaxy is far too big for that.
I admire your commitment. Soon, I hope I can live up to your example.
I admire your dedication to the Empire. Such longevity is valuable.
I adore seeing you suffer.
I advise a strategy of overwhelming force to defeat the Jedi.
I agree, but how can we be sure it's safe?
I agree.
I aim that end at the enemy.
I aim to kill. We will succeed.
I aim to!
I ain't changing my mind.
I ain't dyin' on this planet, and I definitely ain't dyin' on patrol on this planet!
I ain't dyin' to no rancor!
I ain't goin' anywhere near that saber!
I ain't had a good meal in weeks.
I ain't holdin' out much hope for you.
I ain't impressed!
I ain't never seen that before.
I ain't soft.
I ain't worried about the Imps, no sir!
I almost feel bad for it. Almost.
I almost feel sorry for you.
I almost feel sorry for you.
I almost hope he surprises us.
I almost lost myself.
I already duplicated the device's frequencies. We can now access any site she's sealed.
I already found them. They're gonna start a holotactics table at Pyloon's.
I already know Sorc Tormo's put a fresh bounty on my head.
I already know how I'll eradicate the traitor.
I already know. 
I already miss it.
I already secured that. Don't open it!
I already showed you my authorization.
I already tried it. It's all useless in this muck.
I always liked this city. Good place to disappear.
I always remain disciplined until the orders have been completely carried out. 
I always succeed.
I always thought Rayvis would blow up this town, or Greez would poison us all with his cooking.
I always wanted to hunt down a Jedi.
I always wondered something about the Jedi. Your ideals teach patience, peace, humility, yet these were empty mantras.
I am ZN-A4, of course.
I am ZN-A4. Humble servant to the Jedi Order.
I am a BX-series commando droid designed for infiltration and heavy combat.
I am a combat unit, not a scout unit.
I am acting like it. You'll see.
I am afraid its value is not negotiable.
I am afraid not - perhaps if you acquired more scrolls?
I am all that is required.
I am alone.
I am anticipating what would be most effective against a Jedi.
I am at your side, Cal!
I am attacking.
I am back.
I am calculating an answer.
I am calculating battle strategies.
I am calculating viable stratagems for combat against Jedi enemies.
I am choosing to ignore your lack of belief in this matter.
I am constantly ready for combat.
I am damaged.
I am delighted you have experienced the same wonder there that I did.
I am designed to kill Jedi.
I am doubtful.
I am eager to crush any and all opposition.
I am eager to do my part in protecting the galaxy!
I am eager to fulfill our directive to eliminate the Jedi.
I am eager to see the Jedi's lightsaber in action.
I am excited to see Tanalorr.
I am extremely heavy. Stealth is not an option.
I am fine.
I am fine.
I am firing.
I am glad he has joined your quest.
I am glad of that.
I am going to end you. 
I am going to make the Jedi suffer in ways they cannot imagine.
I am gonna mess up any Jedi who comes anywhere near me.
I am happy to assist further.
I am here. I am all that is needed.
I am hit.
I am hit.
I am immobilizing the target.
I am in need of repair - [grunt]
I am indifferent.
I am initiating it correctly.
I am led to believe there is a vast network of subterranean waterways beneath the temple.
I am looking forward to hunting the Jedi down.
I am looking forward to it.
I am movin' in!
I am not afraid.
I am not designed for carrying organics, only terminating them.
I am not designed for long-distance traversal.
I am not good with animals.
I am not interested in spending more time on this planet than is necessary.
I am not losing this. 
I am not programmed to be impatient.
I am not programmed to hinder.
I am not programmed to relax. I am always vigilant.
I am not required to socialize, only to neutralize enemies.
I am not responsible for that.
I am not spent yet!
I am not your enemy!
I am not.
I am one of the Named Few - we who choose not to conceal our identities.
I am one of the last faces you'll see, I expect. These caves will be your tomb.
I am one of the last faces you'll see, I expect. These caves will be your tomb.
I am one of the last faces you'll see, I expect. These caves will be your tomb.
I am only the Haxion Brood's best hunter. And I will kill you.
I am owed freedom!
I am performing above acceptable parameters.
I am powerful. I am focused...
I am powerful. I am focused...
I am programmed and prepared.
I am programmed for tactics and strategy. I have run many simulations against Jedi.
I am programmed for the hunt.
I am programmed for war.
I am programmed to destroy you.
I am programmed to eliminate all enemies of Rayvis.
I am programmed to kill you.
I am programmed to obey.
I am programmed to project calm in conflict.
I am programmed. You are not.
I am ready for combat, and for Jedi.
I am ready for the Jedi. Let them come.
I am ready for this. 
I am ready for you. 
I am ready to eliminate hostiles.
I am ready to resume.
I am ready to tear apart hostiles.
I am ready.
I am ready.
I am ready.
I am retreating
I am so ready to end some enemies!
I am sorry for your loss. Master Cordova was a good man.
I am starting to think we didn't win the Clone Wars.
I am staying here, for now.
I am stronger.
I am superior.
I am surprised - it looks undamaged.
I am terminating your life.
I am the Emperor's will. 
I am the alpha droid.
I am the backup.
I am the best.
I am the instrument of your destruction!
I am the peak of automated battle infantry.
I am the water beneath the sands. What knowledge do you seek?
I am unaffected.
I am unbalanced.
I am used to how cold Jedha is.
I am very fortunate to have met you, Cal Kestis.
I am very fortunate you came along when you did.
I am vulnerable.
I am your death, Master Junda.
I am your opponent. 
I am! I mean, I will be.
I am, I am, and that's why I'm gonna miss this place.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am. I do enjoy a crowded cantina after being out in the wild.
I am...
I am?
I apologize to you, but not the droids. Never the droids.
I appreciate it, Zee.
I appreciate it, dear. But you can't stop an army.
I appreciate that, Zygg.
I appreciate that, thank you!
I appreciate that. My parents and siblings were soft-spoken, but all of them were defiant.
I appreciate the gusto, I do, but it don't belay my worries all that much.
I appreciate the offer, but this cantina really has become a home.
I appreciate you, Greez, but I'm fine.
I appreciate your initiative, Cal! Let's hurry to the Forest Array!
I appreciate your time and effort, Cal.
I approximate that each patrol route is eighty-four thousand paces.
I asked you to do that, old boy!
I assume you're referring to the Star Destroyer blotting our sky.
I await our next conflict.
I await you in the control tower. Reach me, if you can.
I bagged a Jedi!
I barbeque.
I barely knew my parents.
I barely made it out alive. Now I keep my product clean. Bit pricier, but not as costly as blaster bolt in the back.
I barred the passage. I'm...sorry...
I bear it gladly.
I begin to worry for this project.
I believe I have something.
I believe I'll take your advice and head to the Koboh system. See you there someday, I hope.
I believe he did, yes.
I believe in you, Master!
I believe it's the clan name.
I believe it.
I believe that is the kind of optimism that defined the High Republic.
I believe that to be true.
I believe you may have made an error.
I believe you.
I believe you.
I bet Cordova can fix this up.
I bet I can last ten seconds against a Jedi.
I bet I could beat you in a knife fight.
I bet I could beat you...
I bet I could grab that first one again.
I bet Zee can get the data off this disc.
I bet a lot of folks don't know what to do with this opportunity.
I bet he runs away from us. 
I bet he runs. 
I bet it takes blaster fire about as well as any other armor.
I bet that's exactly what they said before they came into power.
I bet this Senator has more credits stashed up his --
I bet this has been here a while.
I bet those Imperials are using the priorite to construct some secret weapon! Or - or a - a palace!
I bet we can clear that gate with a little boost from our new friend...
I bet we can use that crane somehow...
I bet we could trade this at the outpost.
I bet ya the Imps're coming for us.
I bet you would. Pathetic.
I bet you're feeling tired now.
I bet. Can I borrow him for a few days? I'd love to open him up and see how he works!
I better check this out. 
I better check this out. 
I better find seeds to get started here.
I better go buy a mop or something...
I better throw this.
I botched that...
I bring you death!
I call it hunter's eyes. To trap game, a hunter refines her ability to observe.
I call it my 'not dying' suit. Plus, the ladies love it.
I called in a background check.
I came across a group during my travels. Their goal is to hide Force sensitives from the Empire.
I came across someone in need during my travels and helped them hide from the Empire.
I came across the remnants of many civilizations during my travels.
I came as fast as I could. My master is insistent.
I came as soon as I could Master Khri.
I came here to get away from people like you.
I came out here to look for Zee.
I can already feel the medal on my neck.
I can always run? Start a new life? No, Turgle, not again!
I can and will!
I can ask.
I can barely keep up with this guy. The man's a machine.
I can barely remember a time like that.
I can beat him.
I can beat you without it.
I can catch you!
I can change his mind.
I can chop vegetables twice as fast, and I can't burn myself. Plus it's great for self defense.
I can deal with this.
I can defeat you.
I can definitely work with that.
I can do better.
I can do so much worse to you.
I can do that.
I can do that. I can definitely do that.
I can do this all day!
I can do this all day.
I can do this if you just cover me. 
I can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this. I am capable. I am ready.
I can do without extra problems for a day.
I can feel it, the thrill of the hunt. I hope the chase is worth it.
I can feel it.
I can feel those Anchorites watchin' me from behind their masks.
I can fix that.
I can get a clear shot.
I can get him. 
I can get through.
I can handle myself.
I can handle myself. We got someone else to protect now.
I can hear our enemy.
I can hear you.
I can help ya hook up the wiring.
I can help.
I can hide the Mantis.
I can hold them back!
I can imagine quite a few ways they could suffer.
I can imagine.
I can imagine.
I can keep going.
I can only imagine the horrors they have to go through in training.
I can probably toss that orb from the middle platform to complete the bridge.
I can salvage that B1.
I can see it still: wee Skoova, ushered into yon black-mouthed cave.
I can see that.
I can see why the Raiders tried to kill you.
I can see why you all still stick by her.
I can see why you sit alone.
I can see you trembling from here.
I can see you trying to escape!
I can see you up there. 
I can sense it!
I can sense your fear.
I can sense...something. Hard to discern.
I can smell it. Smells like a glorious Imperial victory.
I can smell the credits.
I can smell the credits.
I can smell your stink!
I can still fight without it.
I can still fight!
I can still function.
I can still hear his last words. 'Trust only in the Force.'
I can still see you!
I can still see you, tin can. Go over there and find some cover!
I can still take you down!
I can still win this!
I can stop you.
I can take my blaster apart and put it back together in less than 12 seconds.
I can take that big beast down!
I can take this out on my own.
I can take you myself.
I can take you out. No problem.
I can tell that you've been in service to the Empire a while now.
I can wait a little longer for victory, if I must.
I can wait as long as it takes!
I can wait, Jedi.
I can wait.
I can wait.
I can withstand that.
I can't afford to look like that.
I can't be blamed for this...
I can't believe Grock is dead.
I can't believe Grock's gone. Did you know him, Cal?
I can't believe Master Cordova is really here. All that time, following in his footsteps...
I can't believe he can do that.
I can't believe he did that!
I can't believe how blind I've been.
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it! Rayvis is gone.
I can't believe it. He's dead.
I can't believe this is it...
I can't believe this!
I can't believe we actually beat a Jedi. 
I can't believe we got it.
I can't believe you did all of this in only a couple of years.
I can't believe you lost him!
I can't break free. 
I can't call a spamel from here.
I can't catch him.
I can't catch the target!
I can't cut it free. Let's pass under it for now.
I can't do this by myself.
I can't do this without cover. 
I can't do this!
I can't escape. 
I can't fail!
I can't fight all your battles. You're better off speaking to Greez yourself.
I can't fight anymore!
I can't find my Mookie doll.
I can't fire through all that.
I can't get a clean shot!
I can't get a clean shot.
I can't get a clear shot.
I can't get a good hit!
I can't get a hit in!
I can't get a response.
I can't get a shot!
I can't get a solid hit!
I can't get an angle.
I can't get down!
I can't get down. 
I can't get him!
I can't get it to work.
I can't get shot!
I can't get through!
I can't get through. 
I can't get up there.
I can't go back to the way things were with us.
I can't grab that.
I can't help it - it's in my programming!
I can't help my nature.
I can't hit him!
I can't hit him!
I can't hit him!
I can't hit him!
I can't hit him.
I can't hit you from here!
I can't hit you from here!
I can't hold this forever, go!
I can't jump that high.
I can't keep doing this...
I can't keep eyes on him!
I can't keep eyes on him. 
I can't keep this up.
I can't keep track of him!
I can't keep track of him!
I can't kill you from here. 
I can't land a hit!
I can't land a hit.
I can't let him get through again.
I can't let you win, Cal!
I can't make an exception, even for someone of your rank.
I can't make any sense of this place, Cal. Be careful.
I can't make contact!
I can't make it past.
I can't make that jump.
I can't make that jump. Not against these winds.
I can't move at all. 
I can't move that.
I can't move this.
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move!
I can't move. 
I can't move...
I can't move?!
I can't open it.
I can't open it. You don't have anything for it, do you?
I can't reach that.
I can't say I've ever really noticed your eyes.
I can't see a thing! We're gonna die here.
I can't see a thing.
I can't see anything past all this fog.
I can't see prospectors showing up here again.
I can't see through all the feathers!
I can't shake 'em!
I can't smell anything.
I can't stand all this damn peace and quiet!
I can't stand this place.
I can't stop him!
I can't stop him!
I can't stop thinking about Cere.
I can't stop, but hello!
I can't take on your negative energy.
I can't talk.
I can't tell what that was. 
I can't tell you how badly I wish I'd gone with him.
I can't tell you whether it's safer to stay or go. But you're better off if you stick together.
I can't think of anything worse than a Jedi.
I can't wait to collect on you. 
I can't wait to end you. 
I can't wait to fight a Jedi. He's gonna find out why I survived so long!
I can't wait to get my hands on that Jedi!
I can't wait to get paid for this. 
I can't wait to get some more action. I'm ready! Bring it on!
I can't wait to kill you.
I can't wait to see Cere again. I owe her big time. She fronted me the credits for Pyloon's.
I can't wait to see that baby in action.
I can't wait to train my sights on that Jedi scum!
I can't wait.
I can't watch!
I can't watch!
I can't work around that!
I can't work with half a droid!
I can't yet!
I can't, not without security clearance.
I can't-
I can't.
I cannot be defeated.
I cannot believe what almost happened to Zee!
I cannot bestow this to you without a fair number of scrolls.
I cannot choose.
I cannot feel tired, or exhausted, or even pain!
I cannot fire.
I cannot part with that without the appropriate knowledge.
I cannot say exactly, but at least a standard cycle.
I cannot see. My photoreceptor is failing.
I cannot strike him.
I cannot thank you enough. But be careful, please. Dagan Gera is the type to hold a grudge.
I cannot wait any longer to face this Jedi.
I cannot.
I cannot. Cere has some friends who need an escort off-planet.
I caught Deedee here jammin' on some recordings.
I caught you!
I caught you!
I caught you!
I caught you. 
I caught you. 
I check in every now and then. Raiders like to pick on the helpless.
I chose to rest instead. That's how I prepare.
I claim victory! Glory! Freedom!
I cleaned this morning! Wait, did I? No, I didn't. That's on me.
I cooked once or twice.
I copy you.
I copy.
I could always take you in alive. Maybe.
I could annihilate you and the galaxy would never notice.
I could ask you the same question, Zygg.
I could ask you the same question, Zygg.
I could barely make out a figure glinting with moonlight.
I could be an outlaw making a fresh start and you'd have no idea.
I could be next!
I could do better than that MagnaGuard!
I could do that.
I could give it a shot, Toa.
I could go for a scazz steak right about now.
I could go for an omelet.
I could have been a BX droid.
I could nae resist the call of adventure - and I had to save ma people.
I could offer you a small loan if required?
I could show ye how tae coax the rarest of fishies onto yer line.'
I could still shoot the Jedi!
I could take him myself.
I could talk about gorocco for days! Please let me.
I could tell you impressed him. That isn't easy.
I could use a break.
I could use a medical droid.
I could use a new poncho.
I could use a research assistant.
I could use some time to my own thoughts.
I could use some time.
I could win this.
I could've done that.
I could've sworn I heard you stirring up a raider-sized problem just outside.
I could've told you that would happen.
I couldn't agree more.
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't even begin to imagine. Nor will I try.
I couldn't get a clear shot!
I couldn't hold on!
I couldn't save him.
I couldn't stop him from getting our last rocket trooper. 
I damaged him!
I dare any enemy of the Empire to test my resolve.
I dare you to download a program for dancing.
I dare you to put a restraining bolt on Monk.
I dare you, take your shot!
I dealt with them.
I defeated you. Fight with me. We can take on Dagan together.
I demand more - more combat!
I deserve an audience with Rayvis.
I deserve that.
I deserve that. Anyway, I saw the strangest duo putting around the far side of the valley.
I despise the Empire. What they desire most is for us all to become the same. Fearful and obedient.
I detect desperation.
I detect extreme levels of hyperbole in your account.
I detect fear.
I detect no hostile entities.
I detect sound.
I did it!
I did it!
I did not expect that.
I did not know he could do that.
I did not know you experience desire.
I did not sleep well last night.
I did not think I would notice the difference, but once you see it...
I did not think I'd have to face a Jedi.
I did not think you would be so easily swayed back into this life.
I did not want to feel better.
I did not.
I did stumble upon a stash.
I did what I could, but there is an Imperial unit up ahead. Thought I should warn you.
I did what the Order was too weak to do. And for that she betrayed me!
I did what you asked, let me go.
I did, Monk! Top to bottom!
I did.
I did. Our relationship was a fair bit contentious. Fool was always trying to sweet talk me.
I didn't ask you to.
I didn't calculate that.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
I didn't even know there were Jedi anymore.
I didn't even speak!
I didn't expect it either. Originally, I couldn't wait to wall myself into a library.
I didn't expect that!
I didn't find anything wrong with it when I checked.
I didn't find the training particularly useful. Especially not for fighting Jedi.
I didn't know Eno Cordova that well, but I'll miss him all the same. Seemed like a nice guy.
I didn't know he could do that!
I didn't know that could happen!
I didn't know them very well.
I didn't know there were any Narkis scouting this close to the Empire.
I didn't know there were any Narkis scouting this close to the Empire.
I didn't know they came off!
I didn't know what he'd become.
I didn't know you could do that!
I didn't let my past control me. Dagan's overwhelmed him.
I didn't mean exactly like yours, just - never mind.
I didn't need backup anyway.
I didn't need this today.
I didn't notice it when we...
I didn't realize how much I missed it until Mosey made the invitation.
I didn't realize the Jedi taught cowardice.
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say that.
I didn't see anything.
I didn't see it coming, Merrin. All of us, going our separate ways.
I didn't see you training this morning with the rest of us. 
I didn't start that fight.
I didn't steal it, if that's what you're asking.
I didn't think a MagnaGuard could be defeated!
I didn't think any of you stayed behind.
I didn't think it was possible, but you're actually blushing.
I didn't think those would come off!
I didn't think you would.
I didn't think you'd survive.
I didn't think... it doesn't matter. There's a fallen Jedi on the loose and it's my fault.
I didn't want to believe something so despicable could have filled the vacuum left by the Order!
I didn't wish my abilities to be exploited by a war machine.
I didn't, but I have a pretty good idea what you wrote about.
I didn't. I never saw him again. But weeks later, I was able to help someone else.
I die, you die, we all die!
I disagree!
I discovered him in a bacta tank on Koboh. He asked me to release him.
I do enjoy your company.
I do hate to lose a bet, you know.
I do like the sound of that.
I do mind.
I do my best.
I do not accept any target's surrender.
I do not believe the outcome of our battle is certain.
I do not care about such things.
I do not care.
I do not expect them to survive, only last a little longer.
I do not expect you to understand. How could you?
I do not feel desire.
I do not feel fear.
I do not feel sadness for enemy slime.
I do not know how to peel my photoreceptors.
I do not know how to process that remark.
I do not know our location. Also, I do not possess a transmitter.
I do not know where this is going.
I do not know.
I do not know.
I do not know. But I suspect there are not many.
I do not know. But you and I both grew up without parents. How are we?
I do not know. She will need time to accept her new life. As will I.
I do not let myself or my gear fall into disrepair. I am ready.
I do not like patrols.
I do not like these droids.
I do not need battle advice from you, or anyone.
I do not possess olfactory sensors.
I do not question it. I would never question it.
I do not recognize this maneuver.
I do not require an explanation of our objective.
I do not require currency to defeat Jedi.
I do not require orders from B1 units to engage Jedi. I will follow my programming.
I do not see any flaws in my assessment.
I do not speak your language, machine.
I do not think help will be arriving at all. We are alone.
I do not understand.
I do not want that to happen to me.
I do not want to cross you, droid, but I like this fiery attitude.
I do not work for Cere.
I do not!
I do not, and don't call me 'Shirley'. One of our patrons brought her here.
I do not.
I do not. But together we've taken on a few bucketheads.
I do something wrong?
I do.
I do.
I do. Everywhere. But there's light, too.
I do. I have learned much of Jedha, but the sands still hold surprises.
I do. I need it.
I do. She nearly burned down the Mantis.
I do?
I don't bite, I promise.
I don't blame you. We'll go soon, okay?
I don't care about all that, I care about the chaos we can bring. Burn it all down.
I don't care about that thing.
I don't care for this moon. Do not care for it.
I don't care what they say about you, Cal. You've got a sense of humor.
I don't care who gets the kill as long as the Jedi is gone. 
I don't care who they are. New. Old. They're traitors and I will make them suffer for what they did to our galaxy.
I don't care. I just kill.
I don't compromise on my price. Ever.
I don't doubt, I hope. The stronger the better.
I don't either.
I don't either. But the entire galaxy either wants me dead or strapped to an interrogation chair.
I don't even need a blaster to fight.
I don't even need to aim.
I don't fear you.
I don't fear your blade, Jedi!
I don't feel great about my chances with a Jedi.
I don't feel like conversation right now.
I don't feel safe in this armor.
I don't feel so great.
I don't fight for praise, that doesn't matter at all.
I don't get to see her as often as I'd like, but at least I can provide for her.
I don't have a landspeeder.
I don't have a shield now!
I don't have access to the laboratory.
I don't have access. I tried to tell them. Please, leave me be.
I don't have access. I've told the others. Please, don't dismantle us.
I don't have all day.
I don't have the best feeling about facing a Jedi.
I don't have time for this. Report your blaster for inspection.
I don't have time for you.
I don't intend to live my life based on the whims of our capricious Empire.
I don't know - the enemy could be anywhere, and we have to patrol here.
I don't know a planet in the Outer Rim free of raiders in general, but these Bedlam bastards have changed Koboh forever.
I don't know a whole lot about you.
I don't know about that. Even in my day, there were scandals and wars.
I don't know anybody who loves the Empire, but, hey, there's money in Imperial salvage contracts.
I don't know anymore. I just don't want to go down there!
I don't know how he did it!
I don't know if I can do this...
I don't know if I'm ready for what comes next.
I don't know if I'm ready.
I don't know if that's mad or brave, or both, but you watch yourselves up there, y'hear?
I don't know if this garrison could hold against a Raider attack.
I don't know if we can win.
I don't know much, but I know we're in a bad situation with this Jedi.
I don't know what I expected...
I don't know what I was expecting. So much has changed since I first heard its name.
I don't know what I'm programmed for.
I don't know what Rayvis was so worried 'bout.
I don't know what else to say. Cere, I thought -
I don't know what happened to your programming, but it is going to get you destroyed.
I don't know what he's capable of. He could be a danger to her.
I don't know what that is!
I don't know what that was, but they sure didn't see it coming.
I don't know what the protocol is for fighting Jedi - aim and fire? Until he's dead?
I don't know what to do! 
I don't know what to say right now.
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't know what's in 'em, but I can't get enough!
I don't know where he went. 
I don't know where the others are.
I don't know where you find the time.
I don't know which is worse, these winds or the -
I don't know why I asked.
I don't know why they make us wear these things, I want the Jedi to see my face when I kill him.
I don't know why you care about all this stuff.
I don't know!
I don't know! I'm just done with marching around all day.
I don't know, BD. It was an echo in the Force, but wounded, fragmented - like it was missing something. 
I don't know, I mean.
I don't know, but I see something outside!
I don't know, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity to find out!
I don't know, that seems risky.
I don't know, things just don't seem right. Empire's agitated, which makes 'em dangerous.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know. But I am excited to see Greez. How is he these days?
I don't know. Get a meal, or a drink. Tinker. Take a trip? You know, wind down.
I don't know. He seems harmless enough.
I don't know. I mean, you're doing okay on your own. I mean you could clean the potolli-weave every now and again.
I don't know. Just thought we'd mention it.
I don't know. Khri wiped her memory of how to get to Tanalorr, that's all I saw.
I don't know. Oh, that wasn't a joke.
I don't know. We couldn't find him.
I don't know. We couldn't find him.
I don't know. What's it matter?
I don't know. You choose.
I don't like it here.
I don't like our future riding on 'rough estimates'.
I don't like our odds if we run into the enemy.
I don't like that at all!
I don't like that smell...
I don't like the Empire.
I don't like the look of it. We should be careful.
I don't like the look of this.
I don't like the look of this.
I don't like the look of those pincers.
I don't like this!
I don't like this!
I don't like where this is going.
I don't mean to bother you, sir, but are we sure there's an actual Jedi coming here? 
I don't mind it.
I don't mind.
I don't mind. I enjoy guard duty!
I don't need BX support.
I don't need a master, I don't need anybody!
I don't need a shield!
I don't need any fighters between me and my target.
I don't need assistance to finish you.
I don't need heavy support. 
I don't need help to kill you!
I don't need protection.
I don't need that jetpack to beat you.
I don't need that to kill you!
I don't need that to kill you!
I don't need their support. 
I don't need them.
I don't need them. 
I don't need you alive!
I don't plan to give up on the future, no matter the past.
I don't put anything past them.
I don't really know anything about you, Tulakt.
I don't remember anything. What?
I don't remember much, we left when I was little.
I don't remember this.
I don't remember this?
I don't remember. After we all split up, I was unpacking, and there it was.
I don't remember...much.
I don't see any spamels nearby.
I don't see anything like a settlement, though.
I don't see her, BD!
I don't see this ending well for any of us.
I don't see what about this is fortunate.
I don't see what all the fuss is about with that droid.
I don't see what choice we got.
I don't see what's fun about getting chopped up by a lightsaber...
I don't smell anything, what're you trying to pull?
I don't speak Huttese.
I don't speak binary, but I hear ya, BD. Team effort.
I don't suppose they will need them anymore. So feel free, look around.
I don't suppose you could deal with this, ah, creature? We seem to be trapped!
I don't suppose you'd be interested in coming along?
I don't take orders from a droid.
I don't take orders from you.
I don't think Greez would enjoy taking the Mantis underwater, either.
I don't think I can fix that up.
I don't think I can fix that.
I don't think I did anything?
I don't think I have the right weapon for this...
I don't think I'm stomping.
I don't think I've ever seen a Jedi before!
I don't think a lightsaber can stop me - a good blaster will put them down!
I don't think about it.
I don't think any of my training will make me ready for a Jedi.
I don't think anyone's been back here in a while, buddy.
I don't think anyone's been down here in a long time.
I don't think fighting is for you.
I don't think he'll last much longer.
I don't think it will matter against a lightsaber.
I don't think it's getting back up.
I don't think it's working.
I don't think my armor is strong enough.
I don't think my armor will hold long against a Jedi.
I don't think so!
I don't think so!
I don't think so!
I don't think so!
I don't think so, my desperate friend. But to your credit, you have exceeded my expectations.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I don't think so. It's hard to find a place that feels like home.
I don't think that did it.
I don't think that will stop it!
I don't think that worked.
I don't think that worked.
I don't think that's going to help any of us.
I don't think that's good.
I don't think that's quite right.
I don't think that's what he means...
I don't think they like us.
I don't think they saw us. Let's move.
I don't think they're gettin' up again.
I don't think they're getting back up.
I don't think they're okay.
I don't think this is right.
I don't think we should be messing with tech we don't understand.
I don't think we're alone here...
I don't think we're getting through here right now.
I don't think we're making it back...
I don't think you believe that, because I definitely don't!
I don't think you should put so much trust in them.
I don't think you should trust everything you read.
I don't think you're lookin' to keep anything warm.
I don't think you're supposed to.
I don't trust a lucky streak. Not in this galaxy.
I don't trust anyone.
I don't trust her.
I don't trust these droids.
I don't understand all this fuss about the Empire.
I don't understand human emotions. But I do understand loyalty.
I don't understand why we're staged like this...
I don't understand.
I don't understand. It's an echo in the Force, but somehow incomplete, damaged. And that didn't fix it.
I don't understand. What else is there other than my orders?
I don't understand. What has happened?
I don't understand...?
I don't wanna be on this moon one second longer than we need to be.
I don't wanna deal with that thing!
I don't wanna die a washed-up no-clutch on the far edge of the galaxy.
I don't wanna die here!
I don't wanna die here.
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna kill you.
I don't want any trouble...
I don't want rocks thrown at me!
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to be soup. I don't even like to bathe.
I don't want to die!
I don't want to get a court-martial for this.
I don't want to give away our position.
I don't want to have to explain to command why my squad was wasted by zealots. Got it?
I don't want to know if something's over here.
I don't want to patrol anymore. 
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want you here.
I don't, but Cere might.
I don't, but if you see her, tell her I finished that business of hers.
I don't, sorry.
I don't-!
I don't-!?
I don't. But in my experience, high explosives always work.
I don't. Just want to check on a few things, Greez.
I don't. Really, I don't.
I don't. The quieter, the better.
I don't...get it.
I don't...need a lousy...respirator...
I don't...understand.
I don't...understand...
I doubt it, Zee. You're one of a kind.
I doubt it. This base's location is well-hidden.
I doubt she thought it would ever come to this.
I doubt that any of them even remember our designation.
I doubt that.
I doubt that. Now clear out, Senator's orders.
I doubt they're gone. Just a little bruised.
I doubt you could afford it.
I doubt you'd survive alone.
I doubt you'll last a week.
I dragged maself out o' that cave and back to ma village...
I dream of burning down that outpost.
I earned this. You have not.
I endure.
I endure.
I enjoy a good ramble. Alone.
I enter low power for 18 hours.
I entrust essential tasks only to myself, at the Empire's command.
I envy the binary nature of a droid sometimes, I really do.
I envy you - I wouldn't wish this on anybody.
I even found a shiverpede nest. Tried removing it, while they tried removing my head.
I even like fish with no eyes at all.
I even told the old bastard to be careful when he left.
I expect better from you!
I expect that Jedi'll come through here before long.
I expect this will be your first encounter with a Jedi?
I expect you're exploring, hm? Seeking treasure, seeking glory?
I expected better from BX droids.
I expected better of a MagnaGuard.
I expected better. I still expect better.
I expected more chaos, more fun, from all of this.
I expected more from a Jedi.
I expected more from a destroyer droid.
I expected more from a droideka.
I expected more than that.
I expected more.
I expected you to fight harder than that.
I expected you'd return, learned one.
I failed to protect them.
I failed to throw that correctly.
I fear, on account of me helm, that ye've got the impression that I depend on ma suit fer breathin'.
I feel a long-lost exhilaration!
I feel bad for BD. All that time apart, and now Cordova's gone.
I feel good about things. About us, I mean. And the future, I guess. I mean Tanalorr. You know, us on Tanalorr.
I feel great.
I feel it!
I feel it, too. We have long concealed our number, but never before have we gone to such lengths to conceal our purpose.
I feel like I haven't slept in days.
I feel like they're doing more of the killing out here...
I feel like they're judging me.
I feel like we're being watched...
I feel like you been talking up your "birthday next week" for a few moons now.
I feel neither heat nor cold.
I feel so isolated here.
I feel so much hatred towards Bode.
I feel you unraveling!
I feel your fear!
I feel...strange...
I felt nothing!
I felt that stomp from here!
I figured those B2s would last longer.
I figured those B2s would last longer.
I figured. Hey, you know what they say, though.
I find bramlik fascinating.
I find bramlik quite fascinating.
I find it intriguing.
I find its quiet almost deafening, by comparison.
I find our controllers curious.
I find their engineering fascinating.
I find you, I kill you.
I find your will lacking, stormtrooper.
I focus on the moment and trust my training. Overthinking what will happen can make you freeze up.
I follow my combat protocol.
I footslogged me way back to Oondun's cave, but I found it empty - an' somehow colder than I remembered.
I foresaw this victory.
I forgot how much they talk.
I found an amazing shell the other day.
I found an old servo. Might still be good.
I found an opening.
I found him!
I found him. 
I found him. Look up. 
I found no information related to crossing the Koboh Abyss.
I found our bounty. 
I found our target!
I found our target. 
I found out target.
I found something out there.
I found that building you told me about with the roller mines.
I found that giant piasa in the graveyard.
I found the Jedi!
I found the target. 
I found this underwhelming.
I found you. 
I freed him.
I froze. He had to take them out.
I get a dark feeling from you.
I get closer to shut it off, and would you believe it, the ground beneath me gives out!
I get half, right?
I get it. They're weird things. I'd like to know what's in 'em too.
I get it. You're afraid. It's natural.
I get my targets. Always do.
I get that. For some reason, Gabs keeps popping into my head. Hardly knew me, still gave me a hard time.
I get to have all the fun.
I get you're a renegade sort, but you should ease off the death sticks.
I give up!
I give up. I give uuuup!
I go off planet for one second, and the whole place has gone soft!
I go tumblin' down and find meself in a pitch-black cavern. Couldn't see my hand in front of my face!
I go where the Emperor requires me. It is not your business to know where.
I got a hit!
I got a hit. 
I got a research topic for ya. Find a way to leave the planet!
I got a spare room down in the basement made up especially for you, you should check it out.
I got eyes on a Jedi!
I got four hands, smart guy!
I got her. Meet you up there.
I got him!
I got him!
I got him!
I got him!
I got him.
I got him. I got him!
I got it so easy: guard the cliff, crush the locals, look at the scenery.
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
I got it, Greez. Right back at ya. And if you ever wanna get that arm modded, I know a guy.
I got it, I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it? I got it!
I got motion here.
I got nothing.
I got plenty of dirt on you.
I got plenty of things to talk about besides you, kid.
I got stomped!
I got this.
I got this.
I got this. Maybe?
I got tired of playing Sorc's game. Did a bit of freelancing. Sorc gets word and summons me to Ordo Eris.
I got you covered.
I got you now. 
I got you!
I got you!
I got you!
I got you!
I got you!
I got you, Shana!
I got your back, brother.
I got your six, Cal.
I gotcha now!
I gotta admit it's in good hands.
I gotta be quicker. 
I gotta be quicker. 
I gotta get my picks cleaned.
I gotta hand it to ya, kid. Things are looking better than ever.
I gotta say, Cal. I don't feel good about docking the Mantis here.
I gotta say, Greez. A lot has changed, but you seem to be managing alright.
I gotta say, I did not expect that droid to lose.
I greatly enjoyed that kill.
I grew up in a large family, my siblings and I competed with one another.
I grow bored.
I grow weary of the number of missing troopers on the manifest.
I grow weary of this waiting! I need a real challenge!
I guess I am.
I guess I have to fix this, again.
I guess I won. Heh. 
I guess I'll go after him.
I guess I'll go look.
I guess droids don't get to know the plan either.
I guess fine's enough.
I guess he got away.
I guess he's below?
I guess he's just gone?
I guess it's a chase now.
I guess it's a ranged battle now? 
I guess it's about time I find out who I am.
I guess it's just me now.
I guess it's... time to fight. 
I guess knocking isn't an option.
I guess not.
I guess our friend here makes it work.
I guess so, huh?
I guess so. Ahem. But I wanted to say, uh - w... when two radiogenic substances - 
I guess some things never change.
I guess that's it.
I guess that's me. 
I guess that's that. 
I guess that's what I deserve for asking a drink-slinging droid for interior design tips...
I guess that's why I made it, huh. Well, that and the kid.
I guess the blade decided.
I guess the lift doesn't work from here.
I guess the platform is somewhere else.
I guess they weren't so tough in the end.
I guess this will need reporting in.
I guess we are.
I guess we finally get to see Greez's cantina.
I guess we know what happened to those missing prospectors...
I guess we put it to rest.
I guess we should just blast first.
I guess we should look for him. 
I guess we'll see who survives and who doesn't. 
I guess we're out of ranged support?
I guess you aren't budging, huh?
I guess you can't believe everything you read in holobooks.
I guess you have a plan, though, right?
I guess you're used to the cold, huh.
I guess.
I guess.
I guess.
I guess.
I guess.
I guess. But I have to put in so much effort when they're around.
I guess. Greez did a good job with this place. Feels like home.
I guess...
I had a drink from Monk. Then another. Then another. Then anoth-
I had a good teacher.
I had a nightmare about the caverns again. Where old man Phon'Qi made his fortune.
I had been saved by this marvelous creature from the depth of space.
I had forgotten how much time you spend meditating.
I had heard the Jedi were all dead, every last one of them.
I had hoped for more from them.
I had hoped to see it again but that is not to be.
I had no desire tae cross harpoons with dread cap'ns or tae skewer the deadliest fish.
I had some help from a few friends.
I had thought this feeling lost forever.
I had to leave, Cal, in order to see the galaxy on my own terms.
I hadn't given it too much thought.
I hadn't noticed
I hadn't noticed.
I hate big bugs.
I hate bramlik.
I hate bramlik.
I hate everybody, but you, I like.
I hate how they scream all the time!
I hate how they're always rooting through our outpost's scrap heaps.
I hate it here.
I hate it here. I always hated it here.
I hate it when the higher ups are stationed with us.
I hate probe droids.
I hate rawka.
I hate shiverpedes.
I hate the desert.
I hate the wildlife, I hate those Raiders, and I hate those spy droids -
I hate these patrols. They're so dangerous.
I hate these pests!
I hate these things.
I hate these things.
I hate these things...
I hate this planet.
I hate this!
I hate waiting.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I have a daughter. Kata. 
I have a feeling I don't.
I have a feeling facing a Jedi won't end well for me.
I have a feeling we'll see some action today.
I have a limitless capacity for work.
I have a lock.
I have a lot of heavy things that need lifting.
I have a secret about the Raiders.
I have a theory. You...are a very unpleasant person.
I have a visual.
I have an appointment.
I have an idea. But I need an opening.
I have authorization. You're doing nothing wrong.
I have been assigned the position of leadership. I will do as instructed.
I have been craving one of his scazz steaks. But don't tell him that.
I have been hit.
I have been intermittently in low-power mode since my isolation began.
I have been told that before, but when you say it, I believe it, Cal.
I have calculated the Jedi's most likely trajectory is through here.
I have clearance, central command should've called that in.
I have considered several battle scenarios, I am ready for the enemy.
I have defeated the enemy.
I have destroyed this thing.
I have detected a problem.
I have enjoyed getting to know him. I've never met a Jedi with a better sense of humor.
I have enough salt, obviously. Can't leave port without that.
I have eyes on the enemy.
I have faith in you.
I have friends, family! Please, don't kill me!
I have funded ventures so risky they would make a Hutt skip breakfast.
I have heard rumors and none of them were good. What happened?
I have heard you.
I have high hopes you for, droid. You were built for beatin' the unbeatable'.
I have him.
I have killed Jedi before. You will be the next.
I have learned that Jedha is nothing if not surprising.
I have lost components.
I have lost visual contact. 
I have lost visual of the target.
I have made Dagan's vision reality.
I have missed fighting at your side.
I have missed.
I have more tea!
I have much to learn from you.
I have never been defeated in solo combat.
I have never been to Birren. What is it like?
I have never faced a Jedi. My programming provides clear directive, however.
I have never fallen in combat.
I have never seen you fight. Not once.
I have never understood places like this.
I have no affairs. I cannot be killed.
I have no information on that in my memory banks.
I have no memories of... what?
I have no memory of...
I have no need for them. For your help, I insist.
I have no problem destroying two traitors in one day.
I have no recollection...
I have no sense of direction.
I have no time to teach stormtroopers how to survive.
I have no use of credits.
I have not.
I have not. But I look forward to the day I can say I have.
I have now another for you to seek out.
I have now another for you to seek out.
I have now another to seek out, in the southern desert.
I have now! No more deals with raiders. You don't have to tell me twice!
I have observed a great deal of ground in these patrols.
I have often heard noises from within. Did you encounter peril?
I have opened the way. He goes there now.
I have rights, you know!
I have rockets. They are superior.
I have said what I must. It is past. Safe travels, and good tidings to you.
I have seen creatures fight to the death to save their young, but we are not beasts.
I have seen many places in my travels, but nothing quite like this.
I have spent far too long on this forsaken planet. But Tanalorr is nearly mine.
I have surveyed the best route. Follow my lead.
I have sustained damage.
I have taken damage.
I have taken damage.
I have the hopes of the Empire behind me, I cannot fail.
I have the target.
I have time. You do not.
I have to catch him!
I have to get one of those sabers!
I have to go.
I have to hold the line.
I have to respect an answer like that.
I have to say, these weapons are pretty impressive.
I have to stop this while I still can!
I have visual.
I have waited centuries for this victory!
I have you now!
I have you now.
I have you now.
I have you now.
I have you now.
I have you now.
I have you!
I have you!
I have you.
I have, in my time, struck deals with every flavor of unsavory scamp you can imagine.
I have, indeed.
I have. But the worst pain comes from the scars you can't see.
I have. Quite fascinating, though my research was cut short due to the growing Imperial presence.
I have. They gave me water, and a warning.
I have...nothing to fear.
I haven't been this excited since I enlisted.
I haven't come this far just to die. I'll survive, even if I have to kill some lousy Jedi.
I haven't received intel on how to fight Jedi.
I haven't seen anything but fog for weeks!
I haven't seen such fighting since the championship!
I haven't slept at all since the Purge Troopers arrived.
I haven't, and I don't want to.
I haven't.
I haven't. But I will.
I hear Monk's going to be looking after this place.
I hear Pyloon's Saloon is the spot to beat.
I hear a possible threat. 
I hear an intruder.
I hear an intruuud...
I hear movement.
I hear something.
I hear something. 
I hear something. 
I hear stories, you know? About the Jedi. How they used to bring peace at the end of a lightsaber.
I hear the lakes on Naboo are beautiful this time of year.
I hear ya, BD. Let's see.
I hear ya.
I hear ya.
I hear you back there. 
I hear you shifting in the shadows.
I hear you sneaking over there!
I hear you succeeded in your quest.
I hear you!
I hear you!
I hear you!
I hear you!
I hear you!
I hear you've been busy making yourself the Empire's most wanted.
I hear you, Greez.
I hear you.
I hear you.
I hear you.
I hear you.
I hear you. 
I hear you. 
I hear you. 
I hear you. The galaxy is always spinning...
I heard Dagan boarded the first transport out.
I heard Jedi can do things no one can. How do we even have a chance?
I heard Kata singing to herself.
I heard Master Gera keeps that Gen'Dai he beat as a servant.
I heard Master Khri talking of their 'dreams' for the Abyss.
I heard a Jedi can reflect blasts. So you're just making it easier for him.
I heard a noise. 
I heard back from some of my friends who were dismissed from the academy.
I heard from Greez that our brave Cal simply tore through those raiders without so much as breaking a sweat.
I heard if you have a compass, or something, you can get through it just fine.
I heard it's seen a lot of action. The captain told me that it has 'been in more scrapes than a Boonta barber'.
I heard more patrols last night.
I heard reports of hostiles in the area. Let's find 'em before the drill does.
I heard she wiped out a whole squad out in the southern ruins. Time for payback.
I heard some dredge operators discussing a strange structure in the swamp.
I heard some great tunes before I came to this planet. The Tralizees, you ever heard of them?
I heard some news about a Jedi terrorist on Coruscant not long ago.
I heard someone talking dirt about you.
I heard somethin'.
I heard something.
I heard something.
I heard something. 
I heard something. 
I heard something. 
I heard something. 
I heard something. 
I heard something. 
I heard something. Confirm?
I heard that it was a Lambda shuttle. Shot down as it was leaving the base.
I heard that the Jedi is carrying all sorts of firepower.
I heard that the Purge Trooper division had been disbanded.
I heard that!
I heard that. 
I heard that. 
I heard the Raiders are massing their forces.
I heard the boss wants to go through the abyss.
I heard there could be many more Jedi hiding throughout the galaxy.
I heard there's a whole shipload of High Republic knickknacks just sitting around in those spires.
I heard they make those out of skrats.
I heard they sent Purge Troopers to secure the site.
I heard this guy cuts right through people.
I heard we're hunting a target with a laser sword!
I heard we're reinforcing our position in the Mid Rim.
I heard you nearly died. I was crestfallen.
I heard you!
I heard you.
I heard you. 
I heard you. Show yourself.
I heard you...not sure I understand, though.
I held that one just for you.
I held them at bay as long as I could, but -
I hid behind a rock until the rancor left. Wanna know the best part?
I hied to Antine an' tracked me foe to the Garrachus Trench: a fissure sliced clean through the moon's heart.
I highly doubt that!
I hit him.... Why did I do that?
I hit the Jedi!
I hold many curios for you, outlander.
I honestly don't know what to expect!
I honor you with this!
I hope Cal is okay, but we must hurry. There's still time to evacuate the remaining Anchorites.
I hope I can do you proud!
I hope I hit him.
I hope I'm able to get back to my homeworld sometime soon.
I hope Kata's alright.
I hope Master Khri would not judge me a failure, Cal.
I hope command is watching.
I hope he doesn't come back...
I hope he doesn't come back...
I hope he doesn't move.
I hope he makes it easy for us.
I hope he's down for good. 
I hope it can reattach that.
I hope it doesn't get up.
I hope it's really dead.
I hope it's worth it.
I hope my unit is as good as yours one day.
I hope not, it can only end badly.
I hope not, that would be a real tough customer.
I hope nothing goes wrong when the Purge Troopers are around.
I hope reinforcements are on the way.
I hope so, because we're going to find out why they put the Jedi's betrayal down so brutally.
I hope so.
I hope so.
I hope so. I do not fear death, but I would prefer not to die on the Mantis. It's nothing personal.
I hope so. We will take the back route. It is the fastest way.
I hope that compass works.
I hope that hurt!
I hope that hurt!
I hope the Purge Troopers aren't here too long.
I hope the saloon's okay. Turgle, you better not have brought this down on us.
I hope they all get along.
I hope they have Trandoshan funk. That's my favorite.
I hope they're alright.
I hope they're alright.
I hope this Jedi can finally bring me the challenge I've been craving.
I hope this Jedi is as good as they say.
I hope this grenade works.
I hope this hits!
I hope this holds you off.
I hope this hurts.
I hope this hurts.
I hope this hurts.
I hope this provides good sport.
I hope this will assist you.
I hope this works!
I hope to fulfil my programming.
I hope to see you again.
I hope to see you again.
I hope to win this.
I hope today is the day we encounter hostiles.
I hope we don't run into any insurgents...
I hope we encounter some enemies soon!
I hope we get to see some action.
I hope we survive this...
I hope we're ready for him!
I hope we're so lucky next time. 
I hope you die first.
I hope you don't think the saloon replaced you or anything. I mean, you're still a big part of me.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
I hope you find what you're searching for.
I hope you live to regret those words.
I hope you will see in that place what I have seen. 
I hope you're a better chef than I am.
I hope you're enjoying yourself, old boy.
I hope you're hungry.
I hope you're more decisive than this in a fight.
I hope you're right.
I hope you're right. You know I never thought I'd say this, but...
I hope your training holds up against a Jedi.
I hope your travels to the laboratory proved fruitful.
I hope, but we're gonna need a few things to make it feel that way.
I hunt Jedi. They cannot escape me.
I imagine it's because Commander Denvik's been so successful rooting out terrorist cells.
I imagine there are many that remain lost on Koboh.
I intend tae bring it back to the saloon, where I might one day find a mate for it.
I intend to protect what remains.
I intend to.
I intercepted some Imperial communications. Your reputation is growing.
I just bet the twins that the Senator had you in there stuffed and mounted.
I just can't believe...
I just can't hit him!
I just can't see an encounter with a Jedi going well for me.
I just can't!
I just couldn't stop him. 
I just did.
I just don't understand why she didn't see the change in him before it was too late.
I just don't understand. How can this shameful Empire remain in power?
I just finished fixing that!
I just fixed this!
I just follow orders.
I just gave them a nice, firm talking to. Nothing to get twisted up about.
I just got this!
I just had the most loathsome encounter with one o' those battle droids - I worried they might have found you, too.
I just have to aim better.
I just hope I can get a clear shot at the Jedi, is all.
I just hope the Jedi doesn't make too much of a mess of it first.
I just hope they don't notice that my blaster is faulty.
I just hope they're enough of a challenge to satisfy me.
I just keep going through it all in my head. I lost some friends. If I'd done something differently...
I just know I'm gonna get blamed for this.
I just know I'm next. 
I just know something will go wrong. My visor has been making odd noises for days.
I just love hanging out on high security Imperial bases.
I just make sure the targets are good and terminated.
I just need a good, clean opening. I won't throw my chance away.
I just need a second.
I just need one good shot!
I just need some time, Cal.
I just need to be left alone.
I just need to focus.
I just needed a break from you all.
I just needed something else for a while. Something stationary and out of danger's way.
I just pay attention.
I just realized - today's my birthday. Well, on my home planet it is.
I just sensed something, Greez. Did you feel that?
I just thought you'd be interested in -
I just want one thing to go right.
I just want to be alone right now.
I just want to be alone right now.
I just want to get through this one.
I just wish she'd pick a more lively cult.
I just wish there was more of a fight to it.
I just wish we could have stopped the Empire from getting the rest.
I just wish... Never mind
I just... I can't hit him. 
I keep thinking about something Cere once said.
I keep worrying about something bad happening to one of you.
I ken ye couldnae stay away! Ye donnae forsake the sea-spray once it's misted yer gums.
I kept you fed, didn't I?
I kill in my way, you kill in yours.
I killed it?
I knew I could handle it.
I knew I couldn't run forever.
I knew I'd stand over you, sorcerer.
I knew I'd win.
I knew a guy once who tried to give up working for the Hutts.
I knew he couldn't take it.
I knew he would run!
I knew it couldn't handle the Jedi.
I knew it would end like this!
I knew it.
I knew it. I'm gonna die here. Die tryna to kill the unkillable. Just my kriffin' luck.
I knew something was off.
I knew that nozzle was bad!
I knew that!
I knew that'd catch your eye.
I knew the storm wouldn't deter you.
I knew they weren't invincible!
I knew this assignment was a mistake!
I knew this was a bad idea. 
I knew this was sounding too easy.
I knew we had unfinished business.
I knew we'd get stuck here! Game over, man!
I knew you wanted a fight!
I knew you were weak. 
I knew you wouldn't escape!
I knew you'd pick that up.
I know 'em like the hairs on my back.
I know Cere appreciates your help.
I know I heard something.
I know I saw somethin'.
I know I'll get you.
I know I'm just the local cut-up. But I've seen things. Things that'd turn your breakfast in your belly.
I know I've got this.
I know Jedi - I know what you are capable of. And I do not pity your fate.
I know a few tricks, it's nothin'.
I know a place with a view.
I know a shortcut. Stand back.
I know a survivor when I see one.
I know all your tricks, traitor.
I know how hard it is trying to relearn skills you've put to the side.
I know how to lose the Empire.
I know how to turn him. It's so obvious.
I know how you feel...
I know it is difficult, but have faith. The Force will guide us to our true purpose.
I know it's been a minute since you seen me in action, but Ol' Greezy Money only gets better with age.
I know it's not much, but it's home.
I know my place. As should you.
I know my way around, but I'm not a local. Why?
I know that look.
I know that! Why does nobody take notice of me? I'm speaking truth!
I know that. Perhaps I never wanted to admit that...
I know the feeling.
I know the kind of deals you make behind closed doors. 
I know the orders, tinhead.
I know the orders, tinhead.
I know the ruins.
I know these patrols are important but wow, are they dull.
I know things are different from how they used to be, but...
I know things are pretty tough right now, but think about the old days.
I know things have been tough lately, and well, I don't know. What am I trying to say?
I know this effort was futile, but it is my duty, as a botanist.
I know what I want - some excitement in this galaxy!
I know what I want now.
I know what it's like to lose everything.
I know what you are, for what it's worth.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean...
I know what you're capable of.
I know where we're going - press forward.
I know ye're down there...
I know you all had your reasons for leaving.
I know you are below us. 
I know you are down there.
I know you are in pain.
I know you are up there. 
I know you are up there. 
I know you did your best, Cal.
I know you don't believe in the cause.
I know you will.
I know you'll like this one, buddy.
I know you're around here!
I know you're around here!
I know you're around here. 
I know you're around here. 
I know you're around here. 
I know you're around here...
I know you're around here...
I know you're down there!
I know you're down there!
I know you're down there!
I know you're down there.
I know you're down there.
I know you're down there. 
I know you're down there. 
I know you're here. 
I know you're hurting.
I know you're planning some new prank.
I know you're there.
I know you're there.
I know you're there. 
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there!
I know you're up there.
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know you're up there. 
I know your moves.
I know! I've never been on the winning side before!
I know! Why is it our enemies always seem to be the ones to exploit our failings?
I know, I know!
I know, I know! But still, this is the capital of the Empire.
I know, I know! I'm just checking. Being prepared.
I know, I know! The potolli-weave is all hitched. 
I know, I know, we're perfectly safe up here. Right?
I know, I know. C'mon now, it'll be okay.
I know, I know. I'm just being a little tetchy.
I know, I know. Who would you want to win - the Rancor or the Gundark?
I know, I wish I had something uplifting to say. But I don't. I just don't. Not now.
I know, I've seen your cantina.
I know, Kata, I know. But we're very safe in the Mantis.
I know, Zee. It took me a long time to accept it, too.
I know, but what if you're not around?
I know, girl, I know. I feel it too.
I know, it's an impressive selection.
I know, lad. I know.
I know, odd choice, but sometimes you want to be challenged by the music you're listening to.
I know, you can't look away! I'll have to get the whole thing reupholstered.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know. But we were so close, Cere.
I know. Creepy.
I know. I'm sorry.
I know. Just don't brood so much that you lose your edge. We're counting on you.
I know. Little changes, Greez.
I know. They have taken to calling me the 'desert ghost.'
I know...
I left someone important behind when I fled here. Dreyo. Probably doesn't even know I'm alive.
I like 'em nice and frothy.
I like a droid who knows his purpose. Yeah, that's good.
I like fire.
I like shiny fish. I like big fish an' small fish. I like fish wi' eyes splayed wide an' fish wi' eyes pointed straight.
I like that new droid at Pyloon's
I like that outfit, Cal.
I like the attitude, but don't try it.
I like the enthusiasm.
I like the new music in the cantina.
I like the sound of 'overwhelming' - no chance for mistakes, yeah? Whatever it takes.
I like the sound of that.
I like the sound of that.
I like this song, Ashe.
I like those odds.
I like to play with my food.
I like to try to handle my own problems. Guessing that's the same with you.
I like where this is going.
I like where this is going.
I like you, droid, but I will tear your processor from your head.
I like you, soldier. I hope you live.
I like you. You respect the chain of command.
I like your energy, I always have, but sadly I don't think it's gonna be enough.
I like your little droid.
I like your style.
I like your style.
I liked that jetpack...
I liked those commando droids!
I live for the chase.
I live for this!
I live for this!
I look exactly the same as you.
I look forward to analyzing your corpse.
I look forward to it.
I look forward to it.
I looked down!
I looked over to me captain, and he stared right back, wavin' his arms like a gooberfish in heat -
I lost him again. 
I lost him up there. 
I lost him.
I lost him... again.
I lost my grip.
I lost my lab.
I lost some people close to me. Wound's still fresh.
I love a moving target. 
I love it when things don't go to plan - that's when it gets messy!
I love it!
I love it.
I love my job.
I love that little droid you've got there.
I love that one, too.
I love that smell.
I love this chaos!
I love this part.
I love this part.
I love what you did to your hair.
I lucked out.
I made a promise I wouldn't come back here, not after last time.
I made sure my equipment is freshly polished in case the Purge Troopers do an inspection!
I manage, Turgle. I manage.
I managed to convince him to come with us.
I managed to divert power from the ship's climate control to its engines.
I may have to change power supplies soon.
I mean he got rid of the... uh... essential essence of the place!
I mean how smart can they be?
I mean sure, I could go upstairs, but sometimes you just don't wanna make that walk.
I mean the place is creepy but it does have franchise potential.
I mean, Greez can make room on the Mantis, for all of you.
I mean, I understand. The censors have their own careers to think of.
I mean, I'm about to fly freehand into a stellar anomaly with an appetite for starships -
I mean, good. It is your prime function.
I mean, no one can get in, see in, or knows what's up in that tower.
I mean, no. I just thought. Forget it. We'll go when we go.
I mean, not every day you see a Gen'Dai in the flesh.
I mean, so would I, but we don't need that kind of competition.
I mean, there's not gonna be much in the way of credits.
I mean, unless it's you changing your outfit. Bahahaha!
I mean, without you Zygg and I would have never met, and she's the light of my life.
I mean, you know what hurts the worst?
I meant to ask -
I meant to do that!
I mentioned Dreyo, my old partner? Never told him I fled here.
I messed up, BD.
I met someone who also lost his family.
I might be able to help.
I might be busy.
I might be two-hundred years old, but I'm as spry as a Padawan.
I might fall!
I might have located another meditation chamber, Cal.
I might have terminated a traitor or two.
I might just hold you to that.
I might start chargin' ya Cal! Ha ha!
I miss Cere.
I miss her too, BD.
I miss her. Cere sure could bring out the best of people.
I miss sweets. I wonder if Greez could make me something
I miss the taste of banzon, a minty spice that enlivens every tastebud.
I missed him too.
I missed him!
I missed the target.
I missed this!
I missed you, Merrin.
I missed your optimism. It is rare in the galaxy these days.
I missed!
I missed!
I missed!
I missed!
I missed.
I missed. Entirely.
I missed...
I missed?
I missed?
I missed?
I missed?
I missed?
I missed?
I missed?
I moved with such haste, I blew out my motivator.
I much prefer droids over these!
I must admit...
I must be alone now.
I must be vigilant while we are here.
I must become quicker. 
I must break free.
I must destroy you.
I must end this rampage.
I must gather my energy.
I must know! Did you locate the key to Tanalorr?
I must recharge.
I must remain at my post.
I must remain constantly vigilant if I am to root out all threats to the Empire.
I must remain here a little longer.
I must return to Tanalorr.
I must say, I see vestiges of the Order - my Order - in you and your companions. It is most heartening.
I must sever it completely!
I must show you a spring I found recently. The aura there is invigorating.
I must...let you through...
I myself had a well-balanced and nutritional meal to start the day.
I need a break...
I need a break...
I need a breather....
I need a challenge!
I need a less dangerous assignment. 
I need a little Greez time.
I need a minute!
I need a minute!
I need a moment.
I need a moment.
I need a moment. 
I need a sec!
I need a sec!
I need a second!
I need a second!
I need a second.
I need a stim, BD!
I need a stim, buddy.
I need a stim.
I need a target to eviscerate.
I need an update - why is my head fuzzy?
I need assistance!
I need cover and time. 
I need cover!
I need cover!
I need cover!
I need help!
I need help!
I need help, bud!
I need her help. We're looking for something connected to the Order.
I need more time!
I need more time!
I need more!
I need one!
I need reinforcements!
I need some cover!
I need some cover!
I need some help!
I need some space!
I need some time to think, please.
I need some time!
I need some time!
I need some time.
I need some time. Cover me. 
I need something buddy!
I need something to reach that.
I need those B2s in one piece!
I need time!
I need time!
I need time.
I need time.
I need to be more alert. 
I need to clear my mind.
I need to clear my mind.
I need to clear that Koboh matter to create an updraft.
I need to focus.
I need to get off this dust-ridden rock.
I need to get out of here.
I need to inform the other squads.
I need to let command know.
I need to recharge
I need to recharge!
I need to reload!
I need to reload!
I need to reload.
I need to take some leave...
I need you to keep moving.
I need you to source some gear for me.
I needed that!
I needed that!
I needed that.
I needed that. 
I never cared for all the bright lights and glitz here, you know?
I never get tired of seeing that.
I never grow tired. I will patrol for as long as it takes.
I never liked 'em anyway.
I never liked 'em anyway.
I never liked heights.
I never liked those things.
I never put much stock in facts and figures.
I never said that!
I never said where I was from.
I never thought I would find this planet so energizing.
I never thought much of droideka anyway.
I never understood why you left, but, sitting here now it...
I noticed some really ancient tech on this planet.
I obey directives from command units.
I obey the Empire to the letter.
I often come up for the view.
I often used to hunt alongside my sisters.
I once dragged a raider away after a detonator blast.
I once had a patrol on Serenno.
I once used a flamethrower. It was excellent.
I only believe in cleansing fire, myself.
I only believe in looking out for myself.
I only do as my programming dictates.
I only eat what I kill.
I only hope my blaster is up to the task.
I only need proof of death!
I only take orders from Rayvis.
I order you to stop him!
I owe you nothing, Jedi!
I owe you nothing.
I picked up an ascension cable. See anything I can latch onto?
I pity you.
I possess insufficient processing power to complete this request.
I preferred it here when it was empty.
I preferred the cold dark of total power depletion.
I present as gift to Rayvis! Great tribute, yes!
I probably shouldn't say.
I probably would.
I promise, Bode.
I put an end to that Bedlam Raider operation. They won't be a problem anymore.
I put so much work into that droid!
I put those mutts of yours down, didn't I?
I quite like it. I like the sounds.
I racked up 100% accuracy at target practice earlier.
I rarely lose a hunt.
I really appreciate this light plastoid armor.
I really did lose everything, you know. And everyone. That's what brought me to Koboh with what few wares I had left.
I really didn't need this.
I really don't like it here, Cal.
I really don't want you to hurt yourself.
I really gotta learn Huttese one of these days.
I really liked that speeder.
I really missed your cooking, Greez.
I really need a stim!
I really need cover!
I really needed that.
I really wouldn't.
I reckon an old relic like you'd fetch a handsome pile of credits in the core systems.
I reckon you're ready to hear the big yarn...the mystery nobody's cracked!
I recognize that look.
I recognize that weapon.
I recognize this place. The remains of an old pilgrim market. We're almost there!
I recognize you.
I recommend maintaining good relations with raiders.
I refuse to believe this.
I refuse to lose to some wriggling bug!
I refuse to waste my time. 
I refused to cooperate, escaped on an unlicensed shuttle, and here I am.
I refused to cooperate, so he threatened to reprogram me!
I refused to obey and was betrayed by the one I trusted most!
I relish the fight!
I remain ready and primed to combat any and all Jedi threats.
I remain vigilant.
I remember mountains, and birds singing. Mama knew all their songs.
I remember my first blaster.
I remember this feeling!
I remember this planet when there weren't so many interlopers stompin' around.
I remember this. Don't recall what it does, however!
I remember you would sit at the console and hum to yourself while you scanned Imperial comms...
I remember... huh?
I requested leave but it was denied.
I require greater strength than this!
I require more time.
I respect that kind of determination.
I respect that. I understand completely.
I respond in kind!
I returned home tae the frozen shores of Sakavi Tar, where ma tale began.
I rouse the little ones from their slumber.
I said, what's the E - T - A on that shuttle?!
I saw Dagan confront Santari.
I saw Kata, in her room, stormtroopers coming for her, breaking down the door...
I saw a holovid once of a planet that was so green. Papa said he'd take me there one day.
I saw a lightsaber up close once, long time ago.
I saw a lot. A whole lot. My heroes were the spacers who ran supply contracts.
I saw him go down there. 
I saw him go up there. 
I saw it on Coruscant
I saw it on Kashyyyk
I saw movement.
I saw some Jawas in the forest.
I saw some mountains that looked pretty.
I saw some of the cargo manifests recently. Very impressive numbers!
I saw something move.
I saw that coming.
I saw the entire galaxy in her eyes.
I saw them too, but how'd they get across the Abyss?
I saw two troopers eating unauthorized rations.
I saw you enter the warehouse, find anything interesting?
I saw you hide up there. 
I saw you in target practice last night. You were a disgrace!
I saw you with those pelts, yeah?
I saw you!
I saw you, Jedi. 
I saw your things in the back room.
I saw your wanted poster, once. In an Imperial propaganda broadcast.
I say some of those old sandcrabs could use a bit of agitation.
I say we figure it out when we get there. We always do.
I say, sir, are you in need of maintenance?
I scanned our perimeter. Nothing to report.
I scramble up a cliff side. Didn't want to hurt the tibidee, mind you, but I had to save my brother.
I scrubbed ma eyes like an ol' tar scrubbin' the deck - and there she was:
I see 'em, BD!
I see 'em.
I see a big ol' droid, I like to call my best friend.
I see a bilemaw
I see a problem. Down there.
I see a threat.
I see a way back in.
I see an enemy down there!
I see an enemy. 
I see an intruder. 
I see an opening.
I see folks eyeing your priorite stash.
I see him below.
I see him, bud.
I see him.
I see it.
I see more of them...
I see movement below us!
I see movement. 
I see movement. 
I see no more ranged support present.
I see no point in listening.
I see now you are a Jedi.
I see our mark up high. 
I see someone below?
I see someone. 
I see something over there.
I see something.
I see something. 
I see something. 
I see something. 
I see the Jedi. Down there. 
I see them.
I see them. Scum.
I see what you are capable of.
I see why. It's beautiful.
I see you brought the droid back.
I see you down there!
I see you down there!
I see you down there, Jedi!
I see you down there, Jedi!
I see you down there.
I see you down there.
I see you down there. 
I see you down there. 
I see you down there. 
I see you down there. 
I see you down there. 
I see you found new seeds! Plant one and I'll tell you all about it.
I see you have a companion droid. They can add to your holotactics deck by scanning combatants.
I see you over there. 
I see you planted a spine fluff!
I see you shaking. Just don't get in my way.
I see you suffer!
I see you there!
I see you there!
I see you there. 
I see you took care of things here.
I see you trying to escape down there. 
I see you up there!
I see you up there. 
I see you up there. 
I see you up there. 
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
I see you!
I see you've already grown many, many plants to full size! Such a beautiful arrangement.
I see you, Jedi.
I see you, Jedi. 
I see you, Jedi. 
I see you, Jedi. 
I see you, Moran.
I see you, scum!
I see you, sneak!
I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
I see you. Approach.
I see your hopes wither, Kestis.
I see your next move.
I see, I hear, I listen.
I see, and you became his new owner?
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see.
I see. Say no more, Cal, say no more. I know when I'm about to step in it.
I see. So, what happened?
I see. Well, I suppose he had it coming. Still...
I see. Well, no matter. It was just my life's work, all my designs...
I see. Well, you're nothing if not brave, Cal.
I see...
I seek only to find and crush the Jedi.
I sense a foul presence...
I sense fear!
I sense the Jedi. The ones who used this place.
I sense your fear.
I sense...
I sent a B1 to resolve it.
I sent her a quick message from Cere's base. Don't worry, she okayed it.
I sent them back, you could say. In a way that got his full attention.
I serve the Bedlam Raiders.
I serve to hunt traitors. Traitors like this Jedi.
I served once in a planetary suppression, but there were no Jedi there.
I served with distinction at the Battle of Antar 4.
I served with some of these droid models.
I shall ascend, I shall ascend, I shall ascend.
I shall ascend, I shall ascend, I shall ascend.
I shall avenge Rayvis.
I shall avenge all my fallen brethren - for the Bedlam Raiders!
I shall be your end!
I shall break you!
I shall bury you. I shall honor Rayvis. I shall ascend.
I shall bury you. I shall honor Rayvis. I shall ascend.
I shall drag you to destruction!
I shall give you a glorious end!
I shall give you such a glorious death!
I shall lay you low.
I shall lay you low.
I shall make this quick.
I shall not fail!
I shall not fail!
I shall not fall to you. 
I shall not lose you.
I shall overwhelm you!
I shall remain here. But, if you need my council, I will be at the saloon.
I shall stay here.
I shall think on that, Cal.
I shall unleash full fury upon you, Jedi.
I should charge for this. Yeah, tours by Greez.
I should check that our systems aren't all fried after that.
I should go in the tunnels and get that part for Greez.
I should have read the instructions.
I should just sample it for my new album. Turn all that aggression into something creative.
I should keep this for myself...
I should kill you for that. Rayvis would.
I should make sure BD's okay.
I should move back.
I should probably get back to the kitchen, rush hour should be starting anytime.
I should really go check out the bed in the basement.
I should reevaluate our setup.
I should report in.
I should scrap you for that.
I should stay here and make sure the Mantis is safe. Don't want to get stranded here, ya know?
I should take another shower then. Talk to you later, Tulakt.
I should thank you for releasing me. [laughter]
I should use more salt.
I should use the door in the basement.
I should whip up some of Great-grandma Pyloon's mystery mash for old time's sake.
I slew the Jedi!
I smell a payday.
I smell it too.
I snuck into a shipping crate. And lived in aforementioned crate for a long time. A very long time.
I sometimes doubt your devotion to the cause.
I spent many months in search o' them. At long last, I discovered them on the salted shores o' the third moon of Antine!
I spent the last cycle preparing myself for potential combat with the Jedi.
I spy a Jedi.
I stand guard here.
I start shoutin' my bloody head off, and luckily, old No-Boots Korsaa finds me and tosses me a synthrope.
I started trading with the Bedlam Raiders! Drinking's brought me nothing but misery!
I still can't believe Cordova is on Jedha.
I still can't quite process that the Jedi are truly gone.
I still can't shake the image of her zombies crawlin' all over my Mantis!
I still don't get it! Those two go together like snow on Mustafar.
I still stand!
I still think we should've eaten each other.
I strike!
I stroll right into his fighting pit. His goons descend. Sorc thinks he has me...until I start singing.
I struck down those who stood against me.
I studied the galactic economy with some of the greatest minds of Coruscant.
I suggest you watch yours.
I summon strength!
I summon strength!
I suppose I'll never truly understand why Master Khri spared his life.
I suppose I'll rescue myself.
I suppose even the dullest of blades can still be useful.
I suppose if you sniff around long enough, you're bound to eventually find dirt.
I suppose it is.
I suppose that counts as lethal military precision.
I suppose that is kind of similar.
I suppose that's a good thing.
I suppose that's enough for the Council.
I suppose that's some comfort. Not much, but some.
I suppose that's true. But you were quite a helpful distraction.
I suppose that's why we have you droids.
I suppose the realization that I'm two centuries old has left me a bit touchy.
I suppose there'll always be doors that are locked to me.
I suppose you can always come back for it!
I suppose you have a point.
I suppose you have both studied Eussen's Lemma?
I suppose you slept like an akk pup.
I suppose.
I suppose...
I sure am glad to see Zee return unharmed.
I sure do hope you make it through meeting this Jedi, but I doubt it.
I sure have.
I survived this long by never having to be prepared for a Jedi...
I suspect an intruder. 
I suspect he went down from here.
I suspect the ISB has been infiltrated by terrorists.
I suspected as much.
I suspected as much.
I swear I saw something fly by.
I swear I'm loyal to the Emperor. I know my place. Please don't...
I swear you're as dumb as a rancor and twice as ugly.
I swear, if I hear 'desert ghost' one more time...
I swear, if that creep tries to whisper me one more prophecy, I'm gonna lose it.
I take a breath and stay calm. Keep a level head and you'll be able to take care of yourself, and others.
I take it back.
I take the ground from you!
I tangled with a sanheedra, and I think I smell. Do I? Do I smell like sanheedra?
I taste.
I taught you that.
I tell ya, this place really is something.
I tell ya, this planet is a far cry from Lateron.
I tell ye, lad - that metal shark in the sky is givin' me splinters from head tae toe.
I tell you, your beliefs are all well and good, but I'll stick to technology havin' my back.
I tend to find more Priorite veins up here.
I think Cere and my first master would agree with you there.
I think Cere said something like that. 'To live is to lose, but nothing is ever truly lost.'
I think Greez has done a great job with the place. 
I think I can catch him!
I think I can handle that.
I think I can hit him.
I think I can see out of my left eye stem again!
I think I could take a rancor in a fight. I think I could beat a rancor.
I think I do.
I think I hear an intruder. 
I think I hear someone.
I think I hear something. 
I think I heard a noise!
I think I heard something.
I think I lost him. 
I think I missed something...
I think I missed!
I think I need rewiring.
I think I saw something.
I think I saw something.
I think I see a way out, just past that creature.
I think I see something.
I think I see you down there. 
I think I see...
I think I understand, a little. Thank you, it was not my intention to bring up bad memories.
I think I will take you up on that.
I think I'd like to be alone for a while.
I think I'd like to see that.
I think I'll be fine alone.
I think I'll browse a little.
I think I'll do some reading soon.
I think I'll hang onto that one, if you don't mind.
I think I'll have a Salted Staga-Sub.
I think I'll mount your lightsaber. Once you're dead.
I think I'll stay here, thanks.
I think I'll stay out of this.
I think I'm done.
I think I'm done. 
I think I'm getting closer.
I think I'm gonna be sick...
I think I've found a new home - somewhere to plant my feet.
I think I...there! I felt it!
I think Kata would like you.
I think Master Tapal had this one.
I think Sister Taske will want to take a look at this.
I think about a good holobook...
I think about how I got here. What I'd want to try again.
I think he is.
I think he just made it madder!
I think he likes it.
I think he took out our last rocket trooper? I can't really see. 
I think he took out our rocket backup!
I think he went down there. 
I think he's a Jedi!
I think he's calling it quits. 
I think he's dead.
I think he's down there. 
I think he's giving up. 
I think he's gone.
I think he's gone?
I think he's hurt.
I think he's scared of us!
I think he's scared of us. 
I think he's scared!
I think he's shakin'!
I think he's trying to run. 
I think he's up there. 
I think it had something to do with the invasion on Tanalorr.
I think it likes us.
I think it worked.
I think it worked.
I think it's broken.
I think it's inspiring.
I think it's rolling at me!
I think it's safe to say these droids have new masters.
I think it's still troubled.
I think it's true. Just my luck.
I think my armor is compromised.
I think my blaster's malfunctioning. Maybe I should report to the barracks.
I think not.
I think not.
I think not.
I think of the whole kid question like gambling.
I think people are scared of her.
I think protocol fifteen will be an effective deterrent to Jedi maneuvers.
I think she was talking to you.
I think she's talking about Zee.
I think so too.
I think so, although it was certainly simpler before the Empire increased its presence here.
I think so.
I think so.
I think someone else is more qualified to search here.
I think someone is here. 
I think someone is over here. 
I think someone should be asking.
I think someone's here.
I think someone's here. 
I think something's not working here.
I think that creature is trapped.
I think that did it.
I think that did it.
I think that helped.
I think that one's a miss.
I think that was our last flametrooper. 
I think that was our last gunner! I couldn't stop him!
I think that was our last gunner. 
I think that will just anger it further!
I think that worked.
I think that worked.
I think that's a sign to pivot.
I think that's all of them.
I think that's it. The echo faded.
I think that's our droid support down!
I think the echo's subsiding, now.
I think the lightsaber - the shining blade of pure energy? - might give it away.
I think the meaning is clear: you can't reason your way to true enlightenment.
I think the sign-ups are closed.
I think these could be our answer.
I think these could be our answer.
I think these detonators are faulty.
I think they sound beautiful!
I think they'll like it there, buddy.
I think they're busted.
I think things may have changed.
I think this droid has been here for hundreds of years.
I think this droid has been here for hundreds of years.
I think this is charged up?
I think this will do the job.
I think those couplers could hold the orbs we were using.
I think we came across that one.
I think we can do a lot of good there, too.
I think we found that one. What a view.
I think we got lucky.
I think we have a Jedi here!
I think we just found our ticket out of here.
I think we made a new friend, BD.
I think we might be next!
I think we might have found something special.
I think we might have found that one.
I think we need to get that orb out of there, BD.
I think we should chase him. 
I think we should check out the High Republic settlement, first.
I think we should check this out. 
I think we should head south.
I think we're in trouble now.
I think we're ready for the Jedi? I think...so. I think so! Do you think so?
I think we're too much for him. 
I think we've got him. 
I think you are right to have hope. History has always been wont to change course suddenly and irrevocably.
I think you can handle this, BD. 
I think you like it here.
I think you should just give up.
I think you should shoot him now!
I think you two can manage.
I think you two can manage. Just don't let him swim without supervision.
I think you'll regret this.
I think you're full of ideas!
I think you're getting a little too big for your boots, there.
I think you're right about that.
I think you're talking about names. Don't you have a name?
I think you're the real deal, Jedi.
I think...
I think... Yeah that was our last flametrooper.
I think? After so many idle years, who really knows!
I thought B2s were meant to be hardy!
I thought BX droids were meant to be deadly!
I thought BX were superior?
I thought BX were supposed to be good!
I thought I saw him.
I thought I saw something.
I thought I was going to see less action on Coruscant.
I thought I'd seen it all, but it seems you can still surprise me.
I thought Jedi were tougher!
I thought Rayvis was our leader, now there's another?
I thought commando droids were good?
I thought everything got your...mucus in a knot.
I thought he could handle it! He was just nabbin' a fuel injector.
I thought he could handle it! He was just nabbin' a fuel injector.
I thought if I let go of the pain,
I thought it was the real deal, Rayvis. Honest.
I thought it was to seek vengeance for Rayvis and Dagan and -
I thought organics liked music.
I thought that was your purpose.
I thought that would smell worse.
I thought the Jedi were legends. I have heard some horror stories.
I thought the Jedi were meant to be dead!
I thought the roof was falling in.
I thought the sandstorm was bad.
I thought their armor was stronger than that!
I thought there was going to be a real fight.
I thought they were meant to be unstoppable!?
I thought they were supposed to be deadly!
I thought they were supposed to be good!
I thought they were tough!
I thought they'd send someone a bit more, uh
I thought this place would be safe, turns out it's as deadly as anywhere else.
I thought those droids were invincible.
I thought those shields were meant to help!
I thought we agreed not to talk about that.
I thought you had all the answers!
I thought you were off traveling the galaxy. What are you doing on Jedha?
I thought you were supposed to be a Jedi Knight? 
I thought you'd just given up.
I throw on the waterworks. Oh, Cal, you cannot imagine.
I tire of these games.
I tire of these games. 
I tire of this, Jedi. 
I tire of this, Jedi. 
I told them that they were looking at the ashes of a thousand ritually cremated Serenno war heroes.
I told them this was a bad idea.
I told ye, lad, that mine be a dark tale.
I told you, sir, there's nothing I can do.
I told you. Greez lies.
I took a blaster bolt to the knee.
I took down the mogu. It wasn't easy.
I took him out. 
I took someone's life, if that's what you mean.
I traveled all over the galaxy. Remember?
I tried not to fight, but the fight found me on occasion. Never faced a Jedi, though.
I tried searching for her...alas, tae no avail.
I tried to bring him back. Good or bad, there's not many Jedi left.
I tried to build my own droid once.
I tried to hold them off, but more reinforcements are on their way.
I tried to make contact but received no response. So like most of us, I hid.
I tried to, but I lost count. 
I tried! But I think it hates me...
I tried.
I trust Monk. He's practically running the place already.
I trust in the Empire. I trust in the Emperor. That is all I need to know about my orders. 
I trust you and Greez. Which is more than most have in this galaxy.
I trust you boys can do the math.
I try not to dwell what it was like before the Order fell.
I try not to think about Bracca too much. Didn't leave in a good way.
I try not to.
I try not to.
I try.
I understand betrayal.
I understand describing the Force as a formless pattern, although that isn't my perception of it.
I understand our orders. My aim is consistently sharp and accurate.
I understand, Cal. But we had our reasons.
I understand, but this is a desert. These are hardly the conditions for life to thrive.
I understand, but you've got Merrin to protect you.
I understand, feel the same about our home on Birren.
I understand, master, now may I be excused?
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand. 
I understand. Afraid you'll lose.
I understand. As I told you, I lost my parents on Dathomir, my home.
I understand. Hey, if you ever need anything...
I understand. Just remember that you're not alone in all this.
I understand. What's so dangerous, though?
I understand. You need to choose what's best for you. Good luck.
I understand. You're following your code, and I am following mine. I owe him everything.
I understand. You're following your code, and I am following mine. I owe him everything.
I urge you to journey there, and see in that place what I also saw. It was quite moving.
I used his against him.
I used the skills that I learned there to disappear.
I used to go watch them with...
I used to look at holo-images when papa was away.
I used to perform in a medicine show.
I usually keep something hidden away up there, just for me you know. But I can share.
I very much hope that you're right.
I visit Cere from time to time.
I visited her home planet when I was looking for something.
I visited it during my early days on Jedha, before the Empire's presence grew.
I wake up way earlier than you.
I wanna have a front row seat when they try out the big gun.
I wanna hurt you.
I wanna see you burn.
I wanna show you something.
I want confirmation before the senator's comms are back online.
I want more!
I want nothing to do with that blade!
I want nothing to do with that gorocco.
I want some more action, who's next?
I want that back!
I want that power!
I want that power!
I want them to know my position.
I want this to hurt!
I want this to hurt.
I want to be like him!
I want to be the one to do it, to finish them off!
I want to damage you.
I want to fight! You...you will get chopped up probably, yes.
I want to fight. Leave patrolling to someone else!
I want to see how you fare.
I want you to suffer.
I wanted to prove to the galaxy that the Empire isn't invulnerable.
I warned you!
I was a teacher.
I was about to take that out!
I was actually -
I was afraid of that.
I was afraid you'd say that. One day someone will open up another cantina...
I was afraid you'd say that. So long as they do what they were programmed for, I suppose...
I was alone for a... a long time.
I was always your best asset during the Clone Wars, and you know it.
I was asking you, not the Canons.
I was born for this!
I was born on Riosa, in the Inner Rim.
I was built for this.
I was counting on those droids...
I was created to be better than you.
I was designed to be better than you.
I was doing fine until you showed up.
I was hard pressed to deny you victory.
I was hoping to run into you.
I was hoping you drowned on Nur when we blew a hole in your underwater base.
I was hoping you'd stop by and maybe take a break.
I was in love. Once...
I was just about to do that!
I was just about to shoot it!
I was just looking through the academy's recent records.
I was just... doing something.
I was just... wait, what was I just doing?
I was looking for the Jedi.
I was moping?
I was not designed for beauty.
I was not designed for long-distance traversal.
I was not designed to float.
I was not much older than you when I lost my family.
I was not prepared for this.
I was perfectly aware and completely immobile. Most embarrassing.
I was personally escorting a shipment of...let's call it a sensitive luxury product.
I was practically an amateur before I scored my jet-boots. Then the jobs came pouring in.
I was prepping a report for the higher ups. I have to include every detail.
I was programmed to be ready. I was built ready!
I was programmed to destroy.
I was promised something interesting, and here you are!
I was required to dress in garish outfits, and read fortunes, while others would scam the audience.
I was right!? What's keeping the secret worth to you?
I was scared that they'd find out who I was, or what I was.
I was short a few credits. Started some small talk. Didn't even need to ask.
I was shy when I was her age.
I was stationed on the Accuser before shipping out. Now that's a dreadnought.
I was taken tae see the mysterious one they call Oondun.
I was talking about Cere.
I was thinking how this cantina reminds me of a celebratory dance on my home planet.
I was thinking maybe we should go to Tanalorr first.
I was thinking that I could help out. You know, take the load off.
I was thinking, maybe we could get the kid a pet.
I was thinking, maybe, that you could look after the saloon. In an official management capacity.
I was told that there's a bird in the swamp that sports a resplendent plumage.
I was trying out an organic phrase. It didn't work.
I was using that!
I was watching that Mosey track a rusher. She's a mighty fine hunter.
I was wondering that myself.
I was working on Bracca as a scrapper. Greez gave me a lift when I needed it most.
I was wrong.
I was...daydreaming...why?
I wasn't done tormentin' him!
I wasn't done with you!
I wasn't expecting to face a Jedi today.
I wasn't going to.
I wasn't having all kinds of trouble until I remembered something my mama used to say.
I wasn't worried. Should I be worried?
I wasn't, but it's a good arm! Where'd you get it?
I wasted a lot of effort on that MagnaGuard.
I wear two ferrocrete bricks on my feet!
I went into a place...and then I heard creepy voices, and I got outta there in a hurry.
I went up to that lift.
I will accomplish all mission directives.
I will achieve military victory through strength, not faith.
I will address you according to protocol.
I will ascertain the threat and dispatch it immediately.
I will avenge that BX unit.
I will be bitterly disappointed if this Jedi does not live up to my expectations.
I will be in the archive.
I will be leaving Koboh soon.
I will be ready, Cal.
I will be the one to put you down, Jedi.
I will be the victor!
I will be the victor!
I will be waiting.
I will blast you!
I will break free of this. 
I will break you here!
I will break you once I'm free. 
I will break you to pieces!
I will break you!
I will break you.
I will break you. 
I will bring them the pain they have brought so many others.
I will bring you such agony!
I will bring you to heel!
I will catch the Jedi. Their kind will be extinct.
I will catch you.
I will catch you.
I will catch you.
I will continue to surveil the area.
I will crush the life from you!
I will crush you.
I will crush your defenses.
I will decide what's best for my family!
I will defeat you.
I will defeat you. 
I will destroy all Jedi scum, as ordered.
I will destroy the next enemy we see in one shot!
I will destroy you, traitor.
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you.
I will destroy you. 
I will detect and destroy all enemies of the Raiders. Including Jedi.
I will develop further strategies.
I will die here if I have to.
I will direct our forces to victory against the Jedi.
I will do my duty as best I can.
I will do this alone.
I will eliminate target from range with blaster fire.
I will end his life slowly, painfully. He will wish it then.
I will end you.
I will end you.
I will end you.
I will enjoy every moment of terminating our enemies.
I will enjoy making you suffer for that.
I will enjoy studying your remains, should your exploration turn sour.
I will enjoy studying your remains, should your exploration turn sour.
I will enjoy studying your remains, should your exploration turn sour.
I will enjoy taking revenge on this Jedi.
I will enjoy tearing the Jedi apart. Piece by piece.
I will enjoy this.
I will ensure you prove your loyalty, trooper.
I will eradicate any threat.
I will escort you back to the Mantis.
I will escort you.
I will eviscerate you!
I will exact revenge.
I will exercise extreme prejudice in dealing with the Jedi!
I will face you again. 
I will find him.
I will find the truth.
I will find them.
I will find them.
I will find you!
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you.
I will find you. 
I will finish you!
I will follow my orders to the letter, no matter the obstacle.
I will follow my programming and engage the target.
I will follow the plan, but there can be no failure. He must be neutralized.
I will forge these raiders into an elite army led by disciples trained in the Force at my temple.
I will fulfill them. Roger, roger.
I will get through. 
I will get you.
I will get you.
I will give you a fitting end.
I will give you death, and freedom.
I will gladly avenge fallen BX droids.
I will gladly teach them.
I will go ahead then.
I will go wherever I am needed, do whatever is required.
I will go.
I will grant you only death.
I will gut you!
I will have my victory!
I will have what is owed!
I will have you!
I will have you!
I will have you!
I will have you, Jedi!
I will have your hearts for this!
I will have your life, Jedi!
I will honor Rayvis by bringing him your head!
I will hunt the Jedi down. There is no escaping.
I will investigate. 
I will join you.
I will join you.
I will keep guard, Cal. Do not worry.
I will kill in the name of the Raiders.
I will kill it.
I will kill you!
I will lay you low!
I will lead droid forces into battle against the Jedi.
I will lead us into battle, no matter the outcome!
I will learn to prevent that, Cal.
I will leave for Rambler's Reach soon. But first I must gather my thoughts.
I will leave nothing of you!
I will locate you.
I will look after the outpost. The Raiders may strike if they think we are vulnerable.
I will make sure the Jedi knows pain before they die.
I will make sure you're eliminated.
I will make this beast suffer.
I will make you hurt. 
I will make you pay for this. 
I will make you regret that.
I will make you suffer. 
I will mask our approach.
I will mask our approach.
I will mask our approach.
I will meet you inside.
I will meet you inside.
I will meet you outside the base where they gather.
I will meet you up ahead.
I will never cease.
I will never forget. I will honor your teaching and your sacrifice.
I will never stop!
I will not allow them to escape.
I will not be denied!
I will not be denied! 
I will not be imprisoned again.
I will not bend. 
I will not fail.
I will not fail.
I will not fail. 
I will not fall to you.
I will not fall. 
I will not lose to you. 
I will not lose you too.
I will not lose. 
I will not lose. 
I will not miss.
I will not miss. 
I will not return.
I will not return.
I will not yield to you!
I will not.
I will open the way.
I will point my blaster at him, and fire until he's dead!
I will prevail.
I will process this combat data and learn...hopefully.
I will protect the Empire. 
I will protect the Mantis. Be careful.
I will protect you.
I will punish you for that.
I will put an end to you! Now!
I will relish every second of vivisecting you!
I will relish in your death, Jedi!
I will relish tearing you apart!
I will relish your death, Jedi.
I will remain in the desert.
I will remain strong. 
I will remain vigilant for their arrival.
I will see this battle won!
I will see you up ahead.
I will seek and I will find.
I will set you free!
I will show you no mercy. In turn, I would expect none from you.
I will slap you in your metal mouth.
I will stay here.
I will stay here. Hurry, we need to reach the safe house and look for Brother Armias.
I will still defeat you.
I will still have you!
I will still kill you.
I will still terminate you. 
I will stop you here.
I will stop you.
I will stop you.
I will strike you down.
I will succeed!
I will take care of them, child.
I will take my freedom from you!
I will take that lightsaber from your corpse.
I will take this creature apart!
I will take this monster down.
I will tear it down to the bolts and reprogram it to serve me as it once served her.
I will tear you asunder.
I will terminate the Jedi scum before he can attack.
I will think of you, when I see Tanalorr once again.
I will transmit the rendezvous coordinates to your pilot.
I will triumph where they failed.
I will unlock the terminal.
I will wait here.
I will wait then.
I will work you to the bone, Greez Dritus.
I will, Cal. Thank you.
I will, if you fail to comply with my orders.
I will, just saying... you better have my back. 
I will, thanks.
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will. Once I know it's safe.
I will. Once I know the path is safe.
I win some, you lose some.
I win some, you lose some.
I wish I could be a fearless warrior like you. But I can't, so I'm glad you're around.
I wish I could be as effective and well-regarded as a Purge Trooper.
I wish I could do that.
I wish I could see that Jawa village. But I can't. I'm a coward!
I wish I could tell you the dark side is in the past for me...
I wish I could think like you do, bud. Wait, no I don't - you're madder than a sun-baked bramlik!
I wish I could've done something.
I wish I had a lightsaber.
I wish I had armor like yours.
I wish I had better squadmates...
I wish I had two more arms. You're so lucky.
I wish I knew family was coming. This place is a mess.
I wish I wasn't in command...
I wish it were that simple.
I wish there was something to do. 
I wish they would give me a sword.
I wish things were different, but...
I wish this outpost had a bacta tank.
I wish those Raiders would just leave us alone.
I wish to fulfill our mission.
I wish you could have seen it, too, BD.
I wish you well...
I wish you'd come over here. 
I wish! It'd take some serious acrobatics to access it, and...
I woke up like this.
I won't allow that to happen.
I won't back down.
I won't be defeated.
I won't be intimidated.
I won't be long, just gotta look for that laboratory Cordova found in the archive database.
I won't bow to you!
I won't break focus. 
I won't break!
I won't bring it up again.
I won't die here, not to you. Not to anybody.
I won't die yet!
I won't die, not here!
I won't disappoint you, then.
I won't end up like him.
I won't fall for that again.
I won't fall so easily.
I won't fall, traitor. 
I won't fall.
I won't fall.
I won't falter!
I won't falter.
I won't falter. 
I won't forget.
I won't get hit. 
I won't give you the chance to do that again!
I won't go down as easy.
I won't go out like this!
I won't have it!
I won't have to.
I won't hesitate, I just need to get them in my sights.
I won't let him escape next time.
I won't let him escape.
I won't let the presence of a Jedi cloud my judgement. I must stay focused.
I won't let up.
I won't let you do that again.
I won't let you escape.
I won't let you escape. 
I won't let you get away.
I won't let you get in our way.
I won't let you kill me.
I won't let you stop me. 
I won't let you stop us!
I won't let you take me out like that!
I won't let you win, traitor.
I won't let you win.
I won't lose them again.
I won't lose you!
I won't lose you. 
I won't lose!
I won't make mistakes like that!
I won't make that mistake.
I won't miss again.
I won't miss that creature.
I won't miss that jumpin', diggin' bug!
I won't miss!
I won't miss.
I won't miss. 
I won't move.  
I won't say anything, of course.
I won't say it again.
I won't slip up.
I won't stop.
I won't submit. 
I won't yield!
I won't yield, Jedi.
I won't. Thanks, Mosey.
I won? I won! How do I turn this off?
I wonder how long they were stuck in this stuff.
I wonder how long this has been here.
I wonder how many of the Anchorites survived.
I wonder if I'll get promoted for doing such a good job?
I wonder if Koboh will have any legends about me.
I wonder if Zee would know more about this.
I wonder if a droid like you could support my weight.
I wonder if anyone in Rambler's Reach would know what to make of this.
I wonder if he cares about us at all.
I wonder if one must possess the Force to enter these holy sites.
I wonder if these started growing after the Republic left?
I wonder if you can find others to challenge out there.
I wonder if you could survive a hit from me.
I wonder what else the Holonet has to say about these creatures.
I wonder what model number it is.
I wonder what purpose I served. You know, before.
I wonder what spamels eat.
I wonder what that is.
I wonder what that was...
I wonder what that was?
I wonder what the scanners picked up earlier?
I wonder what we'll be like on the other side of all this, ya know?
I wonder where it leads to...
I wonder why Dagan sent Rayvis instead of coming here himself.
I wonder...who might challenge your title.
I work hard at not getting blasted.
I work with many talented scientists.
I worked with a Purge Trooper once before, a few postings back.
I would advise against you discovering them.
I would be happy to exchange them for any treasures I have left.
I would be letting go of the people I loved.
I would deliver our enemy's heads to the Emperor personally, given the chance.
I would gladly die for the Emperor!
I would gladly exchange some of the treasures I've unearthed for them.
I would know what you make of Jedha, noble one.
I would know.
I would like to continue the hunt forever.
I would never lie to you!
I would never make such an error.
I would never! Allow me to start from the beginning...
I would not be so quick to judge, Cal Kestis.
I would not have joined up had my faith ever been shaken.
I would not travel by day if I were you. The Empire's presence has grown.
I would prefer to kill him myself, but I'd sooner not answer to Rayvis.
I would really like to take out a Star Destroyer one day. Will you join me?
I would very much doubt that.
I would, but I'm...shy.
I wouldn't count on it, Harr.
I wouldn't fight a raider with water, if that's what you're suggesting.
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
I wouldn't make that mistake.
I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. And I already have enemies here!
I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. And I already have enemies here!
I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. And I already have enemies here!
I wouldn't take Greez's stories too seriously.
I wouldn't wanna mess with you.
I wrote a poem about the outpost.
I yield. [grunt]
I'd actually pay credits for this.
I'd assumed the first time we met you'd be strapped to an interrogation chair.
I'd be scared of me too.
I'd be two rancors.
I'd been feeling rather aimless, so like the pilgrims, I came to find a new direction.
I'd believe it.
I'd bet it was Turgle!
I'd bet my bounty you went above.
I'd better get me mind off it - spin ye a tale?
I'd better report this.
I'd bring you back just to kill you again.
I'd choose the Bedlam Raiders over my old line of work any day of the week.
I'd give anything to wield two blasters!
I'd go even stronger.
I'd have a caf and confection and watch commuters rage in the skylanes.
I'd hoped for more.
I'd hoped to be the one to wake you.
I'd hoped you'd put up more of a fight than this!
I'd knew I'd stand over you, sorcerer.
I'd leave you in the dust, mind. Nothing personal.
I'd like that.
I'd like that.
I'd like to see them try anything with me.
I'd like to see them.
I'd like to see you try that again.
I'd love to chat with you, Cal. But Tanalorr beckons, does it not?
I'd love to chat, but I'd better finish my drink before the next fight breaks out.
I'd love to meet the one who did him in!
I'd make the trip just to see that!
I'd never be able to do that.
I'd never become someone's servant if I was bested in combat.
I'd pay a thousand credits to see your belief versus their brute strength.
I'd rather you don't.
I'd say cautious.
I'd say nice try, but why should I?
I'd say she already has.
I'd say standing out isn't your problem.
I'd say the same about Turgle.
I'd say the same to you, but it seems there is no doubt that you can handle yourself!
I'd say we've already overstayed our welcome.
I'd say, oh, that's very considerate of you. But still no!
I'd sooner be broken down for scrap then get pushed around by anyone else!
I'd still like to try!
I'll annihilate you.
I'll assault you from the air.
I'll avenge that B1.
I'll avenge that B2, and its arm!
I'll avenge you.
I'll bash him!
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'll be back...
I'll be back...
I'll be doing the watching, Cal.
I'll be here, Cal.
I'll be in later, I just gotta run another diagnostic on the Mantis.
I'll be monitoring your progress from here.
I'll be okay. I'll go, once I see my chance.
I'll be ready when you're back.
I'll be ready, no doubt about that.
I'll be ready.
I'll be rewarded...
I'll be sure to keep the useful bits once he's a pile of scraps.
I'll be the one to end this. 
I'll be the one to stop you.
I'll be there in a moment, Cal. Don't wait on my behalf.
I'll be up here.
I'll be waiting.
I'll begin at once.
I'll bend an ear, if you're so inclined.
I'll bet that's what all the other poor saps said right before they were torn into vortex chow!
I'll bet they're guarding something useful, but I'm not going back there.
I'll bet you're hungry.
I'll bind them!
I'll blast him. 
I'll blast the Jedi. Once, twice, then once more just to make sure he's gone!
I'll blast this beast apart.
I'll blast you for that!
I'll blast you.
I'll bleed you dry. 
I'll bleed you more!
I'll bleed you, coward!
I'll blow this thing away.
I'll blow you apart!
I'll blow you apart!
I'll break through!
I'll break through!
I'll break through. 
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you!
I'll break you.
I'll break you.
I'll break you.
I'll break your guard!
I'll break your guard.
I'll break your guard.
I'll break your guard.
I'll break your guard. 
I'll break your resolve!
I'll break your resolve.
I'll bring 'em in.
I'll bring him down!
I'll bring him down. 
I'll burn you out!
I'll call Sorc.
I'll catch every blow. 
I'll catch him!
I'll catch up with you. Gonna fire up the Z-95 for some good old fashioned air support.
I'll catch up, I'm gonna stay on the Mantis, check diagnostics.
I'll catch you soon.
I'll catch you this time. 
I'll catch you two later.
I'll catch you!

I'll have to pick up the slack. 
I'll have to scrap that droid.
I'll have you free soon, Zee.
I'll have you know I was a hero of the Lateron Space Academy!
I'll have you know that, in my heyday, I was known for smooth-talking my way into all sorts of business partnerships.
I'll have you, Jedi!
I'll have your head!
I'll have your head.
I'll have your head.
I'll help you, gladly. Filthy Jedi.

I'll make you regret that!
I'll make you regret that. 
I'll make you something to eat.
I'll make you sorry for that, Jedi.
I'll make you suffer for that.
I'll meet you at the Mantis when you are ready.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
I'll meet you on the other side.
I'll meet you up ahead.
I'll miss her. Sitting alone in the saloon. Never talking.
I'll mop the floor with you.
I'll mop the floor with you.
I'll mount your head.
I'll muzzle ya!
I'll need more for something like that.
I'll need to extend the energy to that matter. Maybe we can use your grinder.
I'll need to find a different around for now.
I'll need to find a different way.
I'll need to find seeds if I want to plant anything.
I'll need visual confirmation before I believe it.

I'll parade your body through the streets, traitor.
I'll pass.
I'll pay that back.
I'll pick you apart.
I'll poke around.
I'll prevail.

I'll prove I'm stronger than a Jedi.
I'll prove my strength by killin' you.
I'll pull my blaster on 'em faster than they can blink.
I'll put my faith in my own strength, and this army of droids, if it's all the same to you.
I'll put this beast out of action.
I'll put ya down!
I'll put you down!
I'll put you down!
I'll record this weakness in my report.
I'll relish bleeding you.

I'll say this for our droid comrades. There sure are a lot of 'em.
I'll scope it out.
I'll scout ahead - you know, secure the perimeter!
I'll see how long this works.
I'll see if I can find them.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll see what I can do...

I'll start with the bad news.
I'll stay by you. As long as it takes until you are safe and happy.
I'll stay here, keep an eye on the Raiders.
I'll stay here.
I'll stick around here until you're back.
I'll stick to ground tactics.
I'll stick to my own finds, thanks.

I'll take you out.
I'll take you out.
I'll take your limbs off, piece by piece.
I'll tell ya Monk, the Bedlam Raiders are gonna be the end of this town!
I'll tell ye more later, lad. The despair...och, the stench...
I'll tell ye more when next we meet.
I'll tell you one thing a B1 droid is good for.
I'll think about what you said.
I'll think it over.
I'll trade my jetpack for your capture.
I'll trade tasks with anyone that wants to check this out.
I'll trade.
I'll try again.
I'll try not to pick too many fights.
I'll try to scrounge something up for ya back at the outpost.
I'll wager you won't last long.
I'll wait for you here.
I'll wait here.
I'll wait.

I'm - I'm really sorry that happened to you.
I'm Cal, this is BD-1.
I'm Cal, this is BD-1.
I'm Cal, this is BD-1.
I'm Cal, this is BD-1. We're going to help you.
I'm Cal.
I'm Cal.
I'm Cal.
I'm Cal. Glad you made it back safe.
I'm Cal. This is BD-1.
I'm Cal. This is BD-1.
I'm Cal. This is BD-1.
I'm Cal. This is BD-1.
I'm Cal. This is BD-1.
I'm Cal. This is BD.
I'm Cal. This is BD.
I'm Cal. This is BD.
I'm Pili. Didn't expect to see any pilgrims today.
I'm Turgle.
I'm a big fan of Ashe's music. Cannot get it out of my head.
I'm a bit confused...
I'm a father.
I'm a little...lost.
I'm a mechanic, not a miracle worker. I can't fix 'em up that good.
I'm a weapon!
I'm afraid it will require more datadiscs.
I'm afraid it's too late to surrender now.
I'm afraid so. In fact, these days, you'd be hard-pressed to name a planet free from Imperial control.
I'm afraid we must say our final farewells, Cal. We have bright hopes for our future...
I'm afraid you'll have to sit tight for a spell, big wheel.
I'm after 'em!
I'm after 'em!
I'm after him!
I'm after him!
I'm after him!
I'm after him!
I'm after him!

I'm after the Jedi.
I'm after the enemy!
I'm after the intruder. 
I'm after the target. 
I'm after you!
I'm ain't afraid of your powers.
I'm airborne!
I'm all ears!
I'm alright.
I'm alright. Got a lot on my mind.
I'm always alert! You never know when you might need to start tearing stuff up!
I'm always careful.
I'm always prepared. Bring it on, I won't let anyone destroy me.
I'm amazed anything grows out here.
I'm an ally against the Raiders.
I'm as shocked as you are. Well, no beast's gonna stand between you and me and that priorite!
I'm assuming that's 'great job, Bode' - so thanks, little guy!
I'm at seventeen!
I'm aware. Thanks for the advice. Let's keep position.
I'm being a little anti-personnel...
I'm better than all of them.
I'm branding you!
I'm bringing me home a Jedi!
I'm bringing you in!
I'm busy, young Jedi.
I'm busy.
I'm calculating eighteen ways to kill you.
I'm certainly eager to try!
I'm chargin' him!
I'm charging up.
I'm checkin' it out.
I'm checking this out. 
I'm chock full of regrets. The last time I saw Cere...
I'm coming for you!
I'm coming for you!
I'm coming for you!
I'm coming for you.
I'm coming with you.
I'm coming! Don't run!
I'm compromised!
I'm coolin' down!
I'm coolin' down!
I'm counting on you to watch my back.
I'm curious to hear what you make of Dagan Gera's history.
I'm curious, Cal, how did you get on after the Order was...no more?
I'm curious. How do you two know each other?
I'm damaged, help!
I'm dancin' around ya, Cal!
I'm decent with money.
I'm definitely getting a promotion.
I'm devoted enough.
I'm devoted. I live to serve the Empire!
I'm doing this flawlessly.
I'm done playing, Jedi. 
I'm done waiting!
I'm done with them.
I'm done with these games. 
I'm done with this one. 
I'm done with this place.
I'm done with you!
I'm done with you.
I'm done. 
I'm ending this.
I'm everywhere.
I'm excited to find you.
I'm excited to see Cere again. Those Anchorites, though, not so much.
I'm excited too. I can nearly taste the free air of Tanalorr.
I'm excited, oh I'm excited!
I'm exhausted!
I'm exhausted. 
I'm exposed!
I'm exposed!
I'm exposed!
I'm exposed.
I'm falling back. 
I'm falling!
I'm falling!
I'm faster than you!
I'm faster than you. 
I'm faster.
I'm faster.
I'm faster.
I'm feeling weak, BD.
I'm fine!
I'm fine, buddy. You don't have to worry about me.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine. The sooner we get moving the better.
I'm firing a rocket!
I'm firing now!
I'm firing!
I'm firing!
I'm floating...
I'm focused, sir. But when that Jedi turns the corner, he better not underestimate me. I'm ready.
I'm following Rayvis straight to the top.
I'm following right behind you, to whatever end!
I'm forgetting something, though, what is it...?
I'm full of surprises.
I'm gettin' pretty fed up, folks treatin' me like a wounded bogling.
I'm getting chilly. Anyone else chilly?
I'm getting nothing.
I'm getting nothing.
I'm getting off the ground.
I'm getting tired of this.
I'm getting to it, just checking in on you.
I'm giving chase.
I'm glad I've gotten to meet you in person, Master Cordova. It's been an honor getting to know you.
I'm glad she wasn't around to see what he became.
I'm glad things turned out well there. Not quite sure we can count on good faith from the Empire, though.
I'm glad to hear you say it, Toa.
I'm glad we can still enjoy her recipes.
I'm glad we found this.
I'm glad we got to see each other again. How long are you staying on Jedha?
I'm glad we're together on patrol.
I'm glad you made it out here. I know the saloon's better for it.
I'm glad you're okay, Skoova.
I'm glad you're with us to protect us on patrol.
I'm goin' along with it, for now. What about you?
I'm goin' in!
I'm goin' up!
I'm goin' up!
I'm goin', I'm goin'.
I'm going after them!
I'm going ahead.
I'm going ahead.
I'm going as fast as I can!
I'm going in!
I'm going in!
I'm going to a place that's safe from the Empire.
I'm going to beat you!
I'm going to beat you, Jedi.
I'm going to beat you. 
I'm going to bleed you dry. 
I'm going to break you. 
I'm going to check this out.
I'm going to destroy you!
I'm going to draw this out. 
I'm going to end you!
I'm going to end you!
I'm going to end you.
I'm going to end you. 
I'm going to end you. 
I'm going to enjoy killing you.
I'm going to enjoy this.
I'm going to enjoy this.
I'm going to enjoy this.
I'm going to enjoy this.
I'm going to enjoy this. 
I'm going to enjoy this...
I'm going to find the issue, and I'm going to take care of it.
I'm going to finish you off.
I'm going to get the blame for this, aren't I?
I'm going to get you!
I'm going to get you. 
I'm going to go look. 
I'm going to have fun with this one.
I'm going to have to call in a security droid. Stay right there.
I'm going to investigate. 
I'm going to make that Jedi so sorry he ever walked on Raider turf.
I'm going to make the Jedi suffer first.
I'm going to petition the High Council to train initiates here.
I'm going to savor this!
I'm going to stop you. 
I'm going to stop you. 
I'm going to stop you. Now.
I'm going to take you down.
I'm going to tear you apart!
I'm going with him.
I'm going, I'm going.
I'm going, I'm going.
I'm gone.
I'm gonna be straight with you, Toa. Folks here are not gonna appreciate that.
I'm gonna chase him. 
I'm gonna chase you. 
I'm gonna check it out. 
I'm gonna check it out. 
I'm gonna check that out. 
I'm gonna crack this one.
I'm gonna demolish you!
I'm gonna die here, I just know it.
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna earn enough credits here to get off this rock, and wipe my record clean.
I'm gonna end this.
I'm gonna enjoy this. 
I'm gonna find my opening. 
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna fire!
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna get my credits.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm gonna hold ya to that, Cal. I don't plan on living out my days on this rock.
I'm gonna hold you to that!
I'm gonna hold you to that.
I'm gonna level with ya. Yes. And now that mine's all mine!
I'm gonna level with ya. Yes. And now that mine's all mine!
I'm gonna light you up.
I'm gonna make so many credits off you.
I'm gonna make you bleed!
I'm gonna make you bleed. 
I'm gonna make you put that back!
I'm gonna patrol harder than any other droid.
I'm gonna put this thing down!
I'm gonna shoot him!
I'm gonna step back.
I'm gonna stop you before you even start: that is not somethin' I'm ready for.
I'm gonna stop you. 
I'm gonna strip you for parts!
I'm gonna take a look around first, see if I can find a

I'm gonna tear you apart!
I'm gonna throw a grenade!
I'm gonna to burn you.
I'm gonna-!
I'm good at what I do and I don't ask the wrong questions. That combination tends to open doors.
I'm good here, thanks.
I'm good, Cal.
I'm good, buddy. Let's go.
I'm good, thanks.
I'm good, thanks.
I'm grateful it's in your hands.
I'm grateful you're here.
I'm grounded!
I'm grounded.
I'm guessing Zee might know about this.
I'm handling it. 
I'm happy for you.
I'm happy to hear that, Cere. Seems like these last years have been good to you.
I'm happy you came in.
I'm having trouble tracking him.
I'm heating you up.
I'm here for Bode Akuna.
I'm here to take you down.
I'm here, aren't I?
I'm here. You all okay?
I'm hesitant to ask, but how...no, nevermind.
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
I'm hit.
I'm hit. 
I'm hit. 
I'm hit. 
I'm hungry. It's reducing the quality of my posture and aim.
I'm huntin' the ferocious Mee. Did ye know the Mee was the very first fish wee Skoova caught?
I'm impressed you're sticking around through all this.
I'm impressed! And worried.
I'm impressed.
I'm in bad shape, buddy.
I'm in your head.
I'm innocent Mister Greez, promise!
I'm innocent Mr. Greez, promise!
I'm investigating!
I'm invincible!
I'm itching to fight something, anything!
I'm itching to try my skills against a Jedi!
I'm just a friend dropping by.
I'm just delighted you've brought the Mantis to another haunted moon.
I'm just doing some thinking, if that's okay?
I'm just glad you're alright.
I'm just glad you're safe.
I'm just going to wait until we're ready to go...
I'm just itching. This suit is not comfortable.
I'm just keeping my scanners running. You should try it.
I'm just not used to this, mate.
I'm just saying -
I'm just saying, I think I'm commander material.
I'm just saying, it's not my fault if I miss a target.
I'm just saying, we've got jetpack troopers for this, don't we?
I'm just so angry, y'know? I don't know what to do with it all.
I'm just spitballin' here, but that does sound like a place that someone could call home.
I'm just superior.
I'm just taking in the view before I take in my bounty.
I'm just taking it day by day.
I'm just too fast!
I'm just trying to keep my head.
I'm just warming up.
I'm keeping my distance!
I'm killing him before he gets the chance to use it.
I'm killing it.
I'm late as it is.
I'm learning so much from my new compatriots. But what of you?
I'm leaving here. Try not to die until we link up.
I'm listening.
I'm locking them down - strike now!
I'm lookin'.
I'm lookin'. Weapons hot.
I'm looking for an old friend. Four arms. Hairy. Big mouth.
I'm looking for power converters.
I'm looking forward to being shown how it's done!
I'm looking forward to fighting this creature.
I'm looking into it. 
I'm looking to get promoted.
I'm looking.
I'm losing consciousness...
I'm lost. Where are we?
I'm lucky to stand with you, stormtrooper.
I'm malfunctioning!
I'm marking that as insubordination.
I'm more of a challenge than a bird.
I'm more of a poncho guy.
I'm more powerful.
I'm more than ready to help you out.
I'm moving out. 
I'm never going to get promoted...
I'm never not ready. Ready is what I do, I rolled off the assembly line ready!
I'm new to this whole riding thing. Think I could stop by and grab some tips?
I'm no fan of Star Destroyers either.
I'm no stranger to the discount market, big wheel.
I'm no threat to you. You should give me the access codes.
I'm not a Bedlam Raider spy. I'm a friend of Cal Kestis!
I'm not a threat.
I'm not afraid of a Jedi! Why should I be?
I'm not afraid of any Jedi weapon.
I'm not afraid of some animal.
I'm not afraid of you now.
I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not chasing you! Nope!
I'm not concerned about that sword.
I'm not doing all the work...
I'm not doing this for Vader. This is for me.
I'm not done on Koboh yet.
I'm not done with you!
I'm not done with you.
I'm not done with you.
I'm not done yet.
I'm not done.
I'm not down yet.
I'm not entirely sure. But they're sensitive to the Force.
I'm not entirely sure. But they're sensitive to the Force.
I'm not exactly amazed.
I'm not getting anything.
I'm not getting too close to that!
I'm not giving it to the Empire.
I'm not going anywhere near that!
I'm not going anywhere near your blaster.
I'm not going back, you can't make me!
I'm not going down there. You do it!
I'm not going near that Jedi!
I'm not going to advance without orders from Command.
I'm not going to be the only one fighting. 
I'm not going to miss my shot!
I'm not gonna hear the end of this...
I'm not gonna tolerate that!
I'm not half the cook you are, Greez. And, maybe only three-quarters the pilot.
I'm not having fun anymore!
I'm not here for fun. I'm here to get the job done. That's what matters, stormtrooper.
I'm not here for the Jedi.
I'm not here to answer your banal inquiries.
I'm not here to kill you.
I'm not here to make trouble. What do you plan to do with all of this?
I'm not hungry...
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.
I'm not interested in these games.
I'm not leaving this post until I take down this Jedi personally.
I'm not leaving you here.
I'm not liking this.
I'm not losing focus, Jedi. 
I'm not messing with you.
I'm not playing, Jedi. 
I'm not programmed to ask questions. And neither are you!
I'm not ready yet!
I'm not ready yet!
I'm not ready!
I'm not responsible for that!
I'm not s'posed to let anyone pass.
I'm not scared of a Jedi! I'm not scared of anything!
I'm not scared of a blaster. 
I'm not scared of a bug.
I'm not scared of some sword. I have a blaster.
I'm not scared of that.
I'm not scared of you!
I'm not scared of you.
I'm not so easily defeated. 
I'm not sure I like where this is going.
I'm not sure enough troops are deployed to handle this threat.
I'm not sure how to take that.
I'm not sure that is a Jedi. Is it?
I'm not sure that's a good idea. The other week, he said he had an old family recipe for frog soup.
I'm not sure what that means but it's exciting!
I'm not sure what to say. I am truly sorry for your loss.
I'm not sure. I... think there's something wrong with my helmet.
I'm not taking the blame if there's a breach over here.
I'm not telling a bounty hunter.
I'm not telling you!
I'm not that fast, Cal!
I'm not the enemy.
I'm not thrilled about it either, but it's the only way we're getting to Tanalorr.
I'm not trying to insult you. It's impressive.
I'm not worried.
I'm not worth your time. It's easier to let me through.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm not. She can wake the dead. Don't worry. You have nothing to be afraid of...usually.
I'm ok. What are you and Zee talking about.
I'm okay, Greez. How are you?
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay. You?
I'm old, and no one wants to talk about me!
I'm on 'em!
I'm on 'em.
I'm on him!
I'm on him!
I'm on him!
I'm on him.
I'm on him.
I'm on him. 
I'm on him. 
I'm on him. 
I'm on him. 
I'm on him. 
I'm on it!
I'm on it!
I'm on it.
I'm on it.
I'm on it. 
I'm on it. 
I'm on the hunt for new audio samples. The soundscape around here is getting pretty stale.
I'm on the hunt. 
I'm on the target.
I'm on the target. 
I'm on them.
I'm on them. 
I'm on watch here. So far, I've spotted one nervous Latero.
I'm on you!
I'm on you. 
I'm on you. 
I'm on your trail.
I'm on, Gabs.
I'm one of you. You should give me the access codes.
I'm onto you.
I'm onto your scams, son.
I'm open!
I'm open!
I'm opening fire!
I'm opening fire!
I'm out of juice!
I'm out.
I'm out.
I'm picking up on something.
I'm pretty hurt.
I'm pretty sure we will.
I'm pretty tired of that outpost, you know?
I'm pretty tired out now.
I'm programmed for this.
I'm programmed to defy the odds.
I'm putting you out of my misery!
I'm ready for more.
I'm ready for whatever awaits.
I'm ready to blast the enemy apart!
I'm ready to take on any enemy.
I'm ready to talk, Zee.
I'm ready!
I'm ready, Sisters and Brothers.
I'm ready.
I'm ready. How 'bout you, BD?
I'm really busy, Cal. Maybe later.
I'm really glad to have you back, Greez.
I'm really not in the mood.
I'm really sorry about this.
I'm reciting Imperial protocols in case of emergencies.
I'm reloadin' here!
I'm reloadin' here!
I'm reloading!
I'm rerouting power from deflectors to the engines!
I'm rescuing you!
I'm rich!
I'm right here. 
I'm saying, this is a date, and we're on it! And if you don't like it, too bad!
I'm seeing a lot of new faces around here.
I'm set!
I'm shaking in my jetboots
I'm sick of these things!
I'm simply faster.
I'm simulating a fight between us in my mind
I'm so bored. 
I'm so glad!
I'm so ready for this. 
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. For everything that happened here.
I'm so tired of chasing you...
I'm sorry Papa hurt you.
I'm sorry Zee. I did not mean to be insensitive.
I'm sorry about Brother Armias.
I'm sorry for what happened to your people.
I'm sorry for what happened to your people.
I'm sorry it has come to this.
I'm sorry my friend.
I'm sorry tae to say that I picked up the harpoon that black day.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should go talk to him.
I'm sorry to hear that. Take care of him, will ya?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Cal. He sounds like a good friend.
I'm sorry, Greez.
I'm sorry, Jedi - the gate must remain closed. Imperial patrols have been spotted in the region.
I'm sorry, Kata.
I'm sorry, Moran. That's rough.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm spotting something.
I'm starting to feel better already!
I'm starting to get a little worried here...
I'm starting to get a little worried.
I'm stayin' on you. 
I'm stayin' on you. 
I'm stepping back.
I'm stepping back. 
I'm still going to kill you.
I'm still here 'cos I ain't never crossed paths with a Jedi.
I'm still standing, aren't I? Still got it.
I'm still stayin' clear of those pincers.
I'm stronger now because of the pain.
I'm stuck!
I'm stuck! Help!
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. 
I'm sure I'll be blamed for this.
I'm sure Pili knows something about this plant.
I'm sure Zee can decrypt this for us.
I'm sure he's fine. He probably just turned off his comm links.
I'm sure he's okay. But for now we have to go it alone.
I'm sure she does. No regrets, Greez. We gotta keep moving.
I'm sure she'd already be very proud of you, Greez.
I'm sure the Emperor won't mind if I deliver you to him in pieces!
I'm sure they have some good traits, too.
I'm sure they're okay.
I'm sure this is nothing to worry about.
I'm sure this is nothing to worry about...
I'm sure we can both benefit from it.
I'm sure we'll be on our way again soon.
I'm sure we'll beat you.
I'm sure you'll be able to find whatever you need to get the Mantis up and running.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I'm surprised the moon's still habitable.
I'm surprised those droids don't rust.
I'm swearing up and down about everything from past marriages to lower back pain. Almost worked, too.
I'm sweating buckets under these clothes. I hate manual labor. And I hate working outside!
I'm takin' off!
I'm takin' you down!
I'm takin' you down!
I'm taking a break. 
I'm taking off!
I'm taking off.
I'm taking point on this pursuit.
I'm taking you down.
I'm taking you down.
I'm taking you down. 
I'm taking you down. 
I'm taking you in. 
I'm taking you out.
I'm taking you out. 
I'm talking Jedi torque.
I'm the better fighter.
I'm the brains of this unit. You're the brawn. Do you know what that means?
I'm the brains, you're the brawn!
I'm the commander here!
I'm the navigator around here - your processor is barely big enough to keep you upright.
I'm thinking of building a droid.
I'm thinking something bigger. Much bigger. Something that matches my new persona...maybe something with teeth?
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking... this one.
I'm tired of chasing you. 
I'm tired of herding stormtroopers. I require a real challenge.
I'm tired of these critters.
I'm told a Jedi is a significant threat. I can't say I've ever encountered one.
I'm too busy to stop.
I'm too fast for you. 
I'm too fast, Jedi!
I'm too fast.
I'm too fast.
I'm too good!
I'm too good!
I'm too much for you!
I'm tossing a detonator!
I'm tracking him down!
I'm tracking him. 
I'm trapped!
I'm trapped!
I'm trapped!
I'm trapped.
I'm trapped. 
I'm trapped. 
I'm tripped!
I'm trying! Its hide is so tough!
I'm uh, gonna go record a bedtime story for Kata.
I'm unsure if this is working.
I'm waitin'.
I'm waiting.
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you. 
I'm winning this. 
I'm with you, Cal!
I'm with you, Cal.
I'm with you, Cal.
I'm with you, Cal.
I'm with you, Jedi!
I'm with you, Jedi.
I'm with you, Kestis.
I'm with you.
I'm with you.
I'm working on it.
I'm worried about what we will find.
I'm worse than any bug you've ever seen.
I'm wounded. 
I'm your ally.
I'm your executioner.
I'm... I'm gonna need a second. 
I'm... injured!
I'm... trapped somehow. 
I've acquired an easy target.
I've already heard this one. You've told it 37 times.
I've always been stronger.
I've always had trouble sleeping.
I've always wanted to be part of something bigger than myself!
I've another tale for you, mate! Got a moment?
I've been a soldier a long time, and I've yet to see a Jedi.
I've been askin' maself just that. In recountin' ma infamous annals, I've been...
I've been better. Much better.
I've been damaged.
I've been delayed long enough!
I've been dreaming of this!
I've been dreaming of your death for so so long. Sleep tight.
I've been dying to meet you.
I've been hit.
I've been hit.
I've been keeping count of traitors whom I've eliminated. 
I've been known to hunt a bounty myself from time to time.
I've been looking for you, Jedi.
I've been looking forward to this.
I've been on guard all day, my aim may not be perfect.
I've been pretty good at that.
I've been reading about it. It's written that visitors often see themselves in the visages of the Kyber statues within.
I've been seeing Raider activity in that old warehouse across the way.
I've been tinkering with droids since I was a kid.
I've been to Utapau, Senator.
I've been to planets in the middle of nowhere, but this is really in the middle of nowhere.
I've been trained to spot Jedi.
I've been training.
I've been training. 
I've been trapped for -
I've been waiting for a challenge like this!
I've been waiting for a challenge like you.
I've been waiting for this -
I've been waiting for this.
I've been waiting for this. 
I've been waiting to fight a Jedi.
I've been waiting to fight a Jedi.
I've been waiting.
I've been working on it.
I've calculated the odds and you're done for.
I've caught the enemy. 
I've caught you, traitor.
I've caught you.
I've changed my mind, we should always target the Empire.
I've cleared another plot for you. Thank you for growing plants to their full potential.
I've cleared more space, so you can cultivate even more life.
I've come too far to get taken out now!
I've devised a new libation inspired by your recent jaunt up the mountain.
I've devoted my entire life to this moment.
I've devoted my entire life to this moment.
I've done it. Surely I will be rewarded.
I've done it. Surely I will be rewarded.
I've done this before.
I've dreamed of fighting a Force user.
I've dropped him!
I've endured worse than this.
I've entrusted a droid with my tuner and sent her to rescue you.
I've experienced two point seven three combat encounters!
I've exploited your weaknesses
I've fought greater foes.
I've fought some battles in my time but this feels different, somehow. Can't put my finger on it.
I've fought the Raiders and Brood before. What makes you think this will end any differently?
I've fought with you droids. You don't last long.
I've found my next victim. 
I've found some local wildlife!
I've found something.
I've found the intruder.
I've found you. 
I've found you. 
I've given you everything I have.
I've got 'em.
I've got a blaster too. 
I've got a chance to find someplace safe. I plan to make good on it.
I've got a contact under us!
I've got a family, a little boy.
I've got a kitchen and plenty of places to hide. I'm doing just fine.
I've got a lot of courage. Remember that time I fixed your roof in the rain?
I've got a potential target up ahead. 
I've got a shot!
I've got a visual on something. 
I've got an opening!
I've got better things to do anyway.
I've got eyes and ears about.
I've got eyes on him!
I've got eyes on the Gorger.
I've got him!
I've got him!
I've got him!
I've got him!
I've got him!
I've got him! Up there!
I've got him.
I've got him.
I've got him.
I've got him.
I've got him. 
I've got him. 
I've got it. 
I've got more fight in me than that!
I've got more for you!
I've got more.
I've got movement above us!
I've got my orders, and you've got yours.
I've got my processors full updating our charming new patron.
I've got nothing.
I've got our mark. 
I've got our target. 
I've got out target. 
I've got plans.
I've got skills, brains, and guts. What do you have?
I've got so many questions, Master Cordova. I don't know where to start.
I've got this beast.
I've got this big ball.
I've got this covered.
I've got this gorger.
I've got this little bird.
I've got this shiverpede.
I've got this!

I've got this!
I've got this.
I've got this.
I've got this.
I've got this.
I've got this. 
I've got this. I've got this. 
I've got thousands of credits down below. They're yours, if you let me go.
I've got three customs officers waving blasters under my nose. So what do I do?
I've got time.
I've got visual contact down there!
I've got ya!
I've got ya!
I've got you covered, Kestis. Go get 'em.
I've got you now!
I've got you now!
I've got you now!
I've got you now!
I've got you now!
I've got you now.
I've got you now.
I've got you now.
I've got you now.
I've got you now. 
I've got you now. 
I've got you!
I've got you!
I've got you!
I've got you, Jedi. 
I've got you.
I've got you.
I've got you.
I've got you.
I've got you.
I've got you. 
I've got your back.
I've grabbed you.
I've grown bored of my training drills.
I've had a few scrapes, but I'm still breathing.
I've had enough of you!
I've had enough of you!
I've had enough of your bullying.
I've had it with you!
I've had more action with target practice.
I've had much worse. 
I've had some paydays in my time, but I can't even begin to imagine a Jedi's payout.
I've had this since I started freelancing.
I've had worse odds.
I've had worse.
I've had worse. 
I've had worse. 
I've had worse. 
I've had worse. 
I've heard Jedi can kill you with a thought. 
I've heard enough droid talk for a lifetime.
I've heard of it. Lots of heavy industry.
I've heard rumors about the creatures on this planet.
I've heard stories about Master Qui-Gon. You knew him?
I've heard that before.
I've heard that before...
I've heard those things can crack ferrocrete!
I've identified the Jedi.
I've killed dozens -- what's one more?
I've killed fast things. Very fast things.
I've learned my lesson.
I've lost count of how many enemies I've killed.
I've lost count of the amount of droids I've seen now.
I've lost cover.
I've lost my jetpack!
I've lost my patience! 
I've lost my protection.
I've lost shield integrity.
I've lost the target. 
I've lost visual contact. 
I've lost visual, searchin'.
I've made up my mind, Jedi. I'm taking these relics.
I've met creatures that have only four brain cells, and even they managed to be less boring than you.
I've needed a fight. 
I've never encountered it myself, but I'm told it is warm and aromatic. Unsurpassed in its flavor profile. 
I've never heard of anything like that.
I've never known Santari Khri to shirk from a challenge.
I've never seen 'em so quick to heel.
I've never seen a city this big.
I've never seen a gorocco up close - they are ugly!
I've never seen a planet quite as quiet as this one before.
I've never seen a storm like that.
I've never seen a weapon like that!
I've never seen anything like that. 
I've never seen one without the shell!
I've never seen tech like this before...and I scrapped some serious machines on Bracca.
I've never seen that before!
I've never seen these powers before.
I've never seen this design before. This droid almost looks like an antique.
I've noticed some pretty fierce creatures in the desert.
I've only ever heard stories about Jedi. Has anyone ever seen one?
I've only let go of my fear.
I've reached 100% accuracy with my blade. You?
I've read some concerning legends about what Jedi can do to a person's mind.
I've seen a lot of beliefs and believers, friend, and there's nothing that says that yours is better than any other.
I've seen a lot of hunters in my day, and I gotta say, you're showin' promise, Cal.
I've seen better.
I've seen far too much in this galaxy to entertain the idea of you as in-charge, droid.
I've seen it all before.
I've seen more of this galaxy than you could believe, but I've still never seen a real in-the-flesh Jedi.
I've seen runyips with more fight than you!
I've seen some dives in my day, but none of them have half the character of Pyloon's.
I've seen some long faces, but yours is still the longest I've seen in some time.
I've seen that aim. Keep that blaster of yours pointed somewhere else.
I've seen that before.
I've seen that nebula from my Z-95. I do not want to fly anywhere near that thing.
I've seen the galaxy, Santari,
I've seen weirder stuff.
I've seen worse, but not by much.
I've seen worse. We got stuck in a pretty nasty swamp on Dathomir.
I've seen ya around Pyloon's.
I've served long enough to know that this is something you should handle.
I've spent years waiting for a chance to avenge my sisters.
I've stumbled.
I've suffered worse.
I've suffered worse.
I've survived worse.
I've taken damage.
I've trained to fight Jedi like you.
I've tried what organics call 'working out'.
I've used a charged shot.
I've wanted to fight a Jedi.
I've worked in venues where botching the serve will earn you a hefty tip from a blaster pistol.
I've wounded him.
I've...never heard anyone say that before, Moran.
I, I don't feel well...
I, uh, heard reports of trooper regiments fleeing from local fauna.
I, uh, meant that I'm here to talk in more of a general sense.
I, uh, said, 'Hold tight Zee!'
I, uh, that shouldn't happen.
I, uh, will...command my unit as... commanded? I'm confused.
I, uhhh, got this, ehh.
I-I can't get it.
I-I don't--!
I-I missed...
I-I think he's injured.
I-I'm alright. 
I-I'm throwing a grenade!
I-it's coming!
I-it's the Jedi!
I... I can take you. 
I... I can't get free!
I... I can't hit him!
I... I can't!
I... I can't...!
I... I got him!
I... I got it?
I... I hear you. 
I... I hit him!
I... I killed a Jedi!
I... I killed it?
I... I lost our target...
I... I made it.
I... I missed.
I... I see you!
I... I slipped!
I... I think I won?
I... I think we won.
I... I'm firing. 
I... I'm on him!
I... I've got him!
I... can't do that again...
I... can't...
I... can't... move...
I... don't believe it!
I... missed.
I... need a status update.
I... ya know what, we're having the usual: Greasy Greez-loaf!
I...I can't get him!
I...I never thought I'd meet you in person.
I...I should...what?
I...I was going to bring that thing down.
I...I will leave the relics here.
I...believe I've, eh...made ma point...hoo. I cannae feel ma nose.
I...can be of use to ya. Yeah, that's it. Whatever you want, I'm your frog.
I...can't make that.
I...can't...move...
I...don't want to know how this got there.
I...don't?
I...feel strange...
I...need a sitrep.
I...need clarity.
I...think I'd better leave it all here.
I...think that helped.
I...uh...
I...well...
I...will be.
I...will certainly do my best, sir.
I..I can't...
ISB never shares their intel.
Ibby shibby.
Ice. Reminds me of Ilum.
Identify that patter.
Identify that sound.
Identify the target.
Identify your masters.
Identify yourself!

Identify yourself!
Identify yourself!
Identify yourself, now.
Identify yourself.
Identify yourself.
Identify yourself. 
Identify yourself. 
Identify yourself. 
Identify yourself. 
Identifying an attacker.
Identifying an enemy with a light sword.
Identifying the target.
If Cal and his friends can find the way to Tanalorr they can just disappear-
If Gabs gets bored, she might slice into Imperial comms for fun.
If I beat you, then you do all my chores for a week!
If I can get my hands on some kebroot, oh then we'd be in business!
If I don't figure this out, I'll never become a Jedi Knight...
If I don't like it, can we make something else?
If I ever find out who made these things...
If I get through that archway, I think I can find a way to the Lucrehulk.
If I had a droid arm, I'd never get tired.
If I had chased them I would have perished, too. Let this be a lesson: always go your own way.
If I have to parse one more Tilaan scroll...
If I have to.
If I miss the first time, I'll just keep on firing until he's taken out!
If I recall correctly, she said that the Order believed that ancient Force users once called Jedha home.
If I see the enemy. I'll shoot him.
If I spot the Jedi, you'll know... and so will he. 
If I stepped foot on a core world again, it would be...bad.
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
If I was a smarter man, I'd say you should do what we all should do: run.
If I were at the business end of a Bedlam Raider rifle, you wouldn't soak up a blaster bolt for me.
If I were you, I wouldn't buy into that nonsense -
If I were you, I'd stick with the classics.
If I'd gone up against a Jedi, my metal friend, I doubt I'd be here tellin' you about it.
If Koboh's future is brighter than its past, then I suppose I won't mind seeing how it all turns out.
If Lord Vader wants Cere Junda, he'd better hurry.
If Rayvis said jump into tar, would you do it?
If Santari had only stood with me, we could have convinced the council that Tanalorr was worth the sacrifice.
If Saw Gerrera sent us, it's gotta be important.
If Stormtroopers come...
If any patrols come, take off.
If anyone comes this way, kill them.
If anyone knows about a lost Jedi world,
If anyone knows how to fix up the Mantis, it's Greez Dritus.
If anyone sees you, it'll blow our disguise.
If anyone tries to interfere...crush them.
If anything they'll switch us out late.
If he asks about the fifty credits I may or may not owe him, tell him I left the planet.
If he comes back - we'll finish him. 
If he did that to me, I'd be furious!
If he gets away, Command will kill us!
If he is, he won't be for long.
If he keeps recovering it's all over... 
If he moves, blast him.
If he survived this long, he must have some skill... or help. 
If he'd set the bar any higher, he wouldn't be able to reach it even with that ridiculous mechanical throne of his.
If he's even still here...
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Or even if it is a little broke, probably best to leave it be.
If it comes down to it, I could detonate myself take us all out.
If it does, you'll definitely hear about it.
If it don't help ya survive in this galaxy, then what's the point? Rayvis was proof of that.
If it isn't my favorite still-alive patient, back for another check-up!
If it lunges at you, it's over.
If it was so important, why isn't he out here?
If it was, we'll never find out...
If it wasn't for me, some friends of mine would still be alive.
If it's a roller mine den, I think you would.
If it's all the same, Cal, I'm going to stay busy here, yeah?
If it's alright with you, let's speak after you've freed me.
If it's just a droid, why don't you go check on it, huh?
If it's privacy you're worried about, mate, don't be.
If memory serves me, they call it a sunrise because the kettleroot bitters will keep you up all night.
If one tablet says 'withers' and the other says 'blooms', neither is universal - by definition.
If only I had never stepped off ma wee rock.
If only Master Cordova were still with us.
If only it was that easy.
If only it weren't covered by me suit.
If only they weren't so kriffin' flimsy.
If only we could ask her...
If only.
If only.
If she's safe, Cal?
If something goes wrong, do we even have backup?
If something is over here, I'll handle it
If that is Rayvis's will, so be it.
If that sack o' seared slime yet plagues the galaxy, I've nae heard stem nor stern of him, nor of his crew.
If that shell overloads, we could be collateral!
If that was a joke, I hope you fall.
If the Jedi comes here, we open fire!
If the Jedi enters this area, I will take him down.
If the Jedi is here to stop Rayvis, I will show him no mercy! Our purpose cannot be undone.
If the Jedi presses you, dodge. Left or right - just move somewhere!
If the Jedi should prevail, he'll come for you next. Do not drop your guard.
If the Order had reacted faster we'd still have a Republic.
If the Purge Troopers are here, that means a fight is brewing!
If the Raiders return, we will make them regret it.
If the enemy appears, can I count on you to hold the line?
If the enemy brings any friends, I'm killing them, too.
If the key to Tanalorr is real, it has be here.
If the others made it out, they'll meet us at the hangar. If not...
If the rest of Zee's story is true, the key to Tanalorr should be around here somewhere.
If the right someone came along, I'd be open to it. Maybe.
If the sound's alive, they'll come, they always do.
If the tail doesn't kill you, the venom will!
If the wind's not blowing in our favor, we'll just have to push through.
If there are Purge Troopers here that means things are serious.
If there are any of 'em left.
If there are no Jedi left, then what's the point?
If there's a Jedi out there, I'm gonna be the one to take them down!
If there's a Jedi, why haven't I seen them yet!?
If they are, then today we become heroes of the Empire.
If they capture him it could put the entire Hidden Path at risk.
If they harmed my speeder, they will learn to fear me.
If they're return, they should be punished. Otherwise, they're likely already dead.
If they're smart, they'll stay far away from us.
If this Jedi is truly as dangerous as they say, I don't see why I would stick around.
If this cantina were on Coruscant, you could quadruple the prices and still have lines out the door.
If this goes poorly, you know it'll be us who gets the blame.
If this is an ISB base, what's Bode doing here?
If this is how I go, so be it!
If this patrol goes well, will you recommend me for commendation?
If those Raider scum try anything, we'll blast them into dust.
If we align the arrays we can create a flight path through the Abyss.
If we all fire we might hit him.
If we believe in Rayvis, and the cause, then no Jedi can bring us down!
If we can activate that crane from here, we can use the panel it's holding to cross over.
If we could blow up the dam, we can raise the tar level.
If we could just reach Tanalorr...
If we do not find an oasis, we will never reach Pilgrim's Crossing.
If we don't all get horribly maimed.
If we don't stay focused, we may never make it there.
If we encounter any on patrol.
If we encounter the Jedi, be smart. He may do things we've never seen before.
If we fail to apprehend the Jedi, then we deserve to be reprimanded.
If we find a way to lift if, we'll be back.
If we follow the code, then we will prevail.
If we hold our nerve, stay the course, then today the galaxy will be safer for our efforts.
If we keep going at this rate, we're going to need a bouncer.
If we leave our post, we'll be reprimanded.
If we lose it's because he took out our heavy artillery. 
If we saw action all day, I could do this all day. 
If we spot any targets on patrol, we light 'em up.
If we stay the path, Rayvis will reward us in ways we cannot imagine.
If we take down a Jedi, maybe I'll finally get recognized by Command!
If we're next, we're doomed!
If what Rayvis says is true, then I don't want any surprises.
If you are hearing this,
If you are hearing this,
If you are willing, visit the ancient site at the far edge of the western desert.
If you are willing, visit the ancient site at the far edge of the western desert.
If you ask me, a little too easy.
If you ask me, the Inquisitorius isn't worth the credits. The ISB's track record is far superior.
If you believe the legends, then this could be a fight to remember.
If you can hit him. You aim like your optics are malfunctioning.
If you cannot overcome me, then I will crush the life from you!
If you catch them, blast them, you idiot!
If you could be any creature, what would you be?
If you die, can I have your landspeeder?
If you don't believe in your own training then you are already dead, stormtrooper.
If you don't, I'll kill you myself.
If you ever come across a Jedi, you may think differently. 
If you ever stray from your path,
If you fall, I promise to avenge your death and kill every last Jedi I can find.
If you feel it again, you will tell me.
If you figured out how to cross the Abyss, you could just...
If you find anything weird or creepy down there, I don't wanna hear about it.
If you find anything, bring it to me.
If you find the planet's name, I'll take you there.
If you get an attack off first, you better strike dead or I will.
If you get arrogant, you die. Just be ready.
If you get close, he won't shoot you.
If you get in my way, I'll take you out too. The Jedi is mine.
If you get in trouble, Cal gets in trouble. He doesn't like to leave friends behind.
If you give me fifteen minutes, I could upgrade your locomotion drive.
If you have the strength left to claim victory, then show me!
If you hear an Imp scream, you'll know I'm near.
If you hear an Imp scream, you'll know I'm near.

If you hurt him, he won't be able to cook you scazz steaks.
If you insist.

If you jump into hyperspace blind
If you lived in Coruscant, you'd have patrons begging for your work!
If you make a mistake around a Jedi, I don't think you'll make it back to Command.
If you need a hand, we're an oasis in the sand.

If you need any supplies you should stop by Rambler's Reach outpost. 
If you need repairs, I'm sure the Anchorites would be happy to help.
If you need to snooze a bit more, just say.
If you plant new seeds, I'll tell you all about them.
If you say so.

If you say so.

If you say so...
If you see a future with Merrin, embrace it.
If you see a guy missing an arm, run.
If you see a mogu like that, it's probably already too late.
If you see a raider, kill 'em.
If you see any pilgrims, shoot to kill.
If you survive, I look forward to picking up where we left off.
If you suspect anyone, doubt anyone, make such people known to the authorities.
If you suspect that your neighbor is harboring terrorists, alert the Coruscant Security Force.
If you wanna keep your family safe,
If you want a break, I could pilot the Mantis. Give you a chance to get some shut eye.
If you want that knowledge from me, you're gonna have to fight for it.
If you want to go home, I can take the traitor out myself. 
If you want, I can erase all your programming.
If you were, you wouldn't fall for them.
If you won't lie for strangers, who will ya lie for?
If you would stop Dagan Gera, you must stop me.
If you're counting on the Raiders keeping their word, I'd double-check your calculations.
If you're doing this, you do it now. No hesitation.
If you're dying of thirst, well, our drinks ain't the worst,
If you're ever willing, I'd love to hear the whole story.
If you're feelin' feisty, we could check it out sometime.
If you're gonna bet, bet big. But if you're not feeling it, there's no shame in walking away from the table.
If you're hoping for a discount, don't.
If you're implying that I came to Koboh a broken Latero, you are way off, mister.
If you're looking for a sight, you might want to trek to the higher edges of the canyon.
If you're ready, I'm ready.
If you're sharing stories, we'll listen.
If you're so notorious, how'd you get here undetected?
If you're with the Raiders, I don't want trouble!
If your weapon overheats, then take the enemy in melee combat.
Igniting thrusters!
Ignore that - focus on the target!
Ignore that blaster fire!
Ignore that, keep up the pressure!
Ignoring enemy commands.

Imagine bein' scared of something so fluffy.
Imagine crossing these gales just to find a safe place.
Imagine if you were unconscious during the last two centuries...
Imagine there be a fish with no gills!

Imagine. No more looking over your shoulder.

Impy's starting to get real mad. Suddenly, I spot something shiny in the distance. Ol' Impy runs ahead to find-
In I go.
In Rayvis I have found new purpose.
In Rayvis's new order, anything is possible.
In a different age, we could visit the Holy City - witness it fully.
In a different age.
In a pinch, a droid core is a good source of power.
In all my years...
In case I get tired.
In case it hasn't clicked, Cal, this guy's not exactly a fan of Jedi.
In case you wanted to drop in.
In combat, we will find justice. And you will find death.
In death, I have set you free.
In each world the Republic reaches out to, there are new opportunities to share and learn.
In fact, I'm going to go and prepare the archive for relocation.
In fact, I've rotated through three identical copies of this outfit for several cycles, now.
In fact, let's never ever do that again.
In fact, my analysis indicates that it is perfectly impossible for an intruder to have made it this far.
In flight.
In half? Really!
In her future, Tulakt will quit fortune telling and get a real job!
In her time, she had no equal. There were other scientists and technicians, yes.
In its way, dear. Maybe we'll go there sometime.
In my arrogance, I felt betrayed.
In my day, the Jedi would say that the Force is a river - and every life a tributary that returns to the greater whole.
In my day, the enemy had some fight.
In my day, we held full moon galas on the mountain top!
In my experience, you only get better at combat through being in it.
In my prime, I could outrun TIE fighters while making an omelet, you know!
In my sights!
In my sights.

In pain? 
In pursuit of the target.

In spite o' me most rabid pleas, the captain jettisoned wee Skoova in an escape pod.
In that case, I would warn that the beast is quick and ferocious - more so on both counts than its lesser brethren.
In the Emperor's new galaxy, all must pull their weight.
In the central desert there is a final place to visit. Master Cordova spoke of it often.
In the end, a droid just ain't as good a soldier as me or you.
In the end, she will determine who she becomes, not us.
In the end, this will all be worth it. I'll gladly kill a Jedi for the end result.
In the end, you were insufficient.
In the hurly-burly of it all, I, well...I lost sight o' maself.
In the last few months, the headmasters have dismissed a dozen more of my colleagues. My friends.
In the name of Rayvis!
In the name of the Emperor: kill!
In the name of the Empire!
In the name of the Empire, I will crush all enemies.
In the past, if I even heard a Jedi could be headin' my way, I went the other direction pretty swift.
In their defense, it's very shiny.
In this galaxy, only strength endures.
In this way I am superior to all organics.
In time the archive will be reclaimed by the sands.
In time, I hope this effort enables me to see Jedha as they once did.
In training, I learned 80% of combat is footwork.
In we go!
In what way?
In your own time.
In, in! Quickly! You're letting the dust inside.

Is the Stinger Mantis the first ship you have owned, Greez?
Is the base far?
Is the district secure?
Is the safe house far?
Is the safe house far?
Is there a problem?
Is there a right raider?
Is there any plant you can't grow?
Is there anyone on Koboh who isn't digging for scraps?
Is there anything else you live for?
Is there anything inside?
Is there anything on this moon we could use on Tanalorr?
Is there anything on this rock that can challenge us?
Is there anywhere on this planet where one can relax safely with friends?
Is there music?
Is there no privacy round here!?
Is there protocol for a broken blaster?
Is there really a rush hour?
Is there someone there?
Is there something over there?
Is there time for a quick tour of Sejan's terminal? I could see if the senator's got anything else we can use.
Is this Jedi strength?
Is this Mookie?
Is this a defective droid?
Is this a monastic planet?
Is this all that remains of the Jedi Order? Pathetic.
Is this all that remains of the Order?
Is this all you have?
Is this correct?
Is this droid defective!?
Is this dust lethal?
Is this how you fight?
Is this leading to some kind of punchline?
Is this necessary?
Is this over yet?
Is this really all a Jedi is?
Is this some kind of trick?
Is this some kinda negotiating tactic? If so, it's terrible.
Is this the best this planet can do?
Is this the best you can do!?
Is this thing effective?
Is this what passes for a Jedi now?
Is this what passes for a Jedi now?
Is this what we do?
Is this your Jedi strength!?
Is this your limit?
Is this your strength, Jedi?
Is your blaster a new model?
Is your droid model designed to fight Jedi?
Is your equipment correctly calibrated? A Jedi will exploit any weakness.
Is your fear so great?
Is your name Zee?
Is your name Zee?
Is your weapon battle ready?
Is!
Is, uh, your suit itchy?
Is... Is anyone back there?
Isn't Koboh a little quiet for Dagan? He's always going from one crisis to the next.
Isn't it a little dark down there for fishing?
Isn't it a marvel? Just inspiring. Hope one day I can build a lift like that.
Isn't it a marvel? Just inspiring. Hope one day I can build a lift like that.
Isn't it just?
Isn't that pretty much everyone?
Isn't that right, Cal?
Isn't there something for you to do?
It Is Worse
It all seems so big. And scary.
It appears that I've found the Jedi.
It appears that was our last Viper droid.
It appears that was our last droid. 
It appears your strategy wasn't up to the challenge.
It belongs with all of us.
It better be. Vader's dogs are always sniffing about.
It burned right through!
It can and will stomp you.
It can be done.
It can be lonely out there. Sometimes it's just nice to have someone by your side.
It can't be over yet.
It can't be over.
It can't be.
It can't end like this!
It certainly won't be good for business, but we'll manage. We usually do.
It costs more than what you've got.
It could be worse, we could have been ambushed.
It could have worked.
It dawned on me! I recalled to me mind the great mating call of the eels - ma last hope!
It depends what you think is nice. Do you think I am nice?
It did nae make a fetching first impression - I've a mind tae give it a third scrubbin'.
It didn't stand a chance.
It didn't want to fight. Gave me a free ride.
It didn't want to fight. Turned out to be friendly.
It does not look good. At all.
It does not matter where. I will end them.
It does not! Good guess, though. Rather, it's my lack of purpose.
It does the job, good motion, and I always know where to find it.
It doesn't look happy to see us.
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't matter now.
It doesn't matter where I go. I'm always alone.
It doesn't stand a chance!
It doesn't stand a chance.
It feels good to command an army.
It feels lonely on Jedha. The desert can seem endless.
It feels no pain.
It feels the same to me.
It glows.
It glows.
It had shelter, provisions. A great idea...until it wasn't. It was shelled. I lost two brothers.
It happened again. Our friends, our family have died...
It happens more than you'd think.
It has nothing left!
It has something to do with the Koboh Abyss.
It hurt when you left. Felt like you quit on us in the middle of a fight.
It is a fool indeed who believes themselves wise when their world ends at the front door.
It is a glorious honor to fight for Rayvis.
It is a great honor to fight for the cause.
It is a heavy weight on our shoulders.
It is a mechanical object. You have no control over it.
It is a sadness to remember, but a comfort to know he remains.
It is a warning for us all, Cal - our passions must not become poisoned by obsession.
It is acceptable.
It is an honor to fight by your side.
It is an honor to meet one she holds in such high regard.
It is an ideal climate from which to launch an assault on enemy positions.
It is because only few of us are needed.
It is clear you require maintenance on your chassis.
It is cold out there. It is always cold out there.
It is critical, of course, that our work remain secret.
It is defenseless!
It is delusion to think your actions have had any consequence.
It is exposed.
It is fruitless! Against me there is only death!
It is good that she was able to save some of it.
It is good to see you.
It is good, then, that you do not need rest.
It is hard to describe, but the more I learned, the more I wanted to get my hands dirty and live it.
It is heartening to know we share such a vision.
It is ideal, yes. But there are also others.
It is like an oasis. A dirty oasis.
It is not concern, it is strategic analysis.
It is not our place to question.
It is not tactically advantageous.
It is only a matter of time.
It is our duty to build a better galaxy for our children. We must all do our part.
It is our duty to make sure his death meant something.
It is part of you.
It is tactically unsound to split the party. I will remain with the unit.
It is that simple.
It is the command of Rayvis that the Jedi be eliminated.
It is the weapon of a treasonous cult. They must all be resigned to dust.
It is time to continue the patrol.
It is time you get what you deserve - death. 
It is time!
It is too dangerous for your ship to land.
It is unbecoming to gossip, and to eavesdrop.
It is up them to interpret my visions as they see fit.
It is very simple. Kill them first.
It is, statistically, possible.
It is.
It is. The Empire's a different beast. Just try to stay clear of them.
It is...taxing.
It isn't dead yet.
It isn't murder if you're doing the galaxy a favor.
It isn't true, then?
It just won't open.
It likely did. But I've come to resent it. Probably the reason why I flung myself here.
It looks even stranger now.
It looks like a new model.
It looks like the orbs activate these bridges.
It looks like you recreated much of the Archive.
It may be grounded, but that ship is still chock full of defense turrets and reprogrammed battle droids.
It may look flimsy, but they have a strong fibrous core keeping them steady!
It may seem peaceful but when disturbed it will charge and trample you.
It means trust your heart.
It means, she's good with plants.
It might be. And now look, don't you start with that whole abdication of responsibility -
It most certainty was.
It must be a pretty great honor to be visited by Purge Troopers!
It must've been a big rock.
It must've been delightful growing up on a planet with so many colors!
It must've taken lifetimes to build this place. Now the people who built it are gone.
It never stood a chance.
It only gets worse from here.
It only wanted to grow on its own.
It reminds me of home.
It says Greez will do the dishes after dinner tonight. Without complaining.
It seemed ma speared carcass had bobbed tae the surface and been caught by a local fisher.
It seems I am lacking in clear strategy.
It seems Turgle's got some fight in him!
It seems flattening is on the agenda!
It seems our destinies are intertwined.
It seems the Raiders haven't forgotten Turgle's little trick. Shame that Zee's the one footing the bill.
It shall do you no good.
It shall do you no good.
It sounds like you have this one in hand, so I'll just leave you to it.
It sounds like you were really on the rise.
It started when the Empire began dumping credits into our projects.
It still will come for you!
It stings, nothing more.
It sure is good to be back online after all those years.
It took some time, but the garden's complete.
It true, then? Nicked that droid back from the Raiders, did you?
It used to annoy me so much. But now, oh boy,  I'd give another arm to hear you fussing again.
It usually does.
It usually means that our sector is of particular significance.
It usually takes awhile.
It was a long time ago.
It was a simple affirmation. I wish you a swift victory.
It was already dead and you don't even have hands. You just kicked it out the door.
It was amazing, wasn't it Master Cordova?
It was amazing.
It was either working for Rayvis or prison.
It was going pretty well until it burst into flames, honestly.
It was good to see you.
It was great to see her after so long, but I keep thinking about how much she's changed.
It was harrowing! Really made me think about my life, you know?
It was him, or me.
It was his home, after all. I can't bring myself to go back there. There are...too many memories.
It was inevitable.
It was interesting to see where you grew up with my own eyes.
It was involuntary! That shiverpede meant business! You just choked under pressure.
It was involuntary! That shiverpede meant business! You just choked under pressure.
It was just in the way.
It was killed by politicians just like you.
It was like it was acting out of spite like a petulant child.
It was like this when I got here.
It was like...a stampede. I couldn't sleep.
It was my discovery!
It was my fault.
It was never going to last.
It was nice to see everyone again.
It was nice to see everyone again.
It was no match for a lightsaber!
It was or you were? 
It was out of the way, seemed quiet. I don't know. I just needed a place to kick my feet up.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
It was the only way through.
It was worth it.
It was. But things were changing. Looking down, you used to see nothing but nature.
It was. That's what I said, right? Oh... you're making a joke. Nice one. 
It was. You are diligent explorers, both of you! It is an exquisite experience, I am happy that we now both share it.
It wasn't a...a conversation, you know? Those crowds just wanted to be able to say they'd seen the next big thing.
It wasn't by choice. The shuttle I was on needed repairs, and it was the closest port.
It wasn't easy.
It wasn't me, I swear!
It wasn't me, I swear!
It wasn't my fault, I swear!
It wasn't my job to bring them in alive.
It wasn't so bad.
It wasn't.
It went fine, we made off with a big stinkin' drive core.
It will always bring joy to take down a traitor to the galaxy.
It will be done.
It will be done.
It will be worth it to bring a fugitive of the Empire to justice.
It will be worth it to finally have an enemy who gives me a challenge!
It will be your grave.
It will continue to fight.
It will continue.
It will lead us to victory and glory.
It will not.
It will still fight!
It will take a torrent of fire to bring me down!
It will take more than that
It will take more than that.
It will take more than that.
It will take more than that.
It will take time to contact the Hidden Path.
It will tear that temple apart.
It will warm you.
It will.
It won't activate.
It won't activate.
It won't be easy to get her back. The Raider base is in the swamp.
It won't be.
It won't budge.
It won't help you. 
It won't last long.
It won't open.
It won't open.
It won't respond.
It won't work.
It worked!
It works!
It works, and it looks great.
It would be cute if it wasn't trying to kill us.
It would be hard to not to, after our last combat encounter.
It would be useful to set an interrogation droid on the Jedi.
It would increase 86%.
It would save us bringing materials from elsewhere...
It would seem there is a deeper purpose to these musings after all.
It'd be a pleasure to look after this place for you a little longer.
It'd be a shame if we blow another gyro and get stuck in the Abyss.
It'd be nice to see one of them right about now.
It'll be a long time before we can risk sending anyone to collect what remains.
It'll be good to see Greez again. Been a long time.
It'll be me stuck fixin' that droid!
It'll be my honor to slay you.
It'll be my honor to slay you.
It'll be my weekend ship. Me and the family.
It'll be over soon!
It'll be over soon!
It'll be over soon.
It'll be over soon.
It'll be the greatest mistake of his short life.
It'll charge you, watch out.
It'll cluck no more.
It'll cost you.
It'll grow back.
It'll grow safe here.
It'll run you down, or through, or both!
It'll take more than that to finish me.
It'll turn you fifteen ways from sundown if you get too close, though.
It's Bode. He's covering his tracks.
It's Cal.
It's Cere.
It's Dagan. The Raiders are after Tanalorr.
It's Like A Dream
It's Merrin, right?
It's a Jedi.
It's a better use of my time than drinking my life away in a cantina.
It's a big district. They're doing general sweeps of the area.
It's a big ol' bilemaw stomp.
It's a close combat fight now.
It's a co-ordinated plan to kill us.
It's a dangerous business, and you can't win 'em all.
It's a date!
It's a date, Gabs.
It's a date.
It's a deal.
It's a disaster.
It's a factory.
It's a gorocco slam!
It's a guess.
It's a guess.
It's a hunt or be hunted galaxy, might wanna throw that Nightsister in the mix.
It's a little flashy for my taste.
It's a live one!
It's a long story.
It's a long story. I'll tell it later, okay?
It's a long walk to the city from here.
It's a long way to the Holy City. Those relics will only slow you down.
It's a long way to the Holy City...they'll only slow me down.
It's a lot more...colorful. And the air smells nice.
It's a new path for all of us.
It's a one on one fight now...
It's a pleasure to have you.
It's a ranged battle now. I never was a good shot. 
It's a ranged battle now. Let's take him down. 
It's a ranged fight now!
It's a real opportunity for us to prove ourselves!
It's a ruin...
It's a shame that there's not a bounty on his head.
It's a small price to pay for everybody's safe arrival.
It's a symbol.
It's a tough climb, but you'll find a way up. And you'll see the true majesty of Koboh. I just know it.
It's a vicious one!
It's about that time. I have to catch the next hauler offworld if I'm gonna make the meeting.
It's about time.
It's absorbant and durable - makes me more confident when the blaster bolts start flying.
It's adorably derelict and entirely unique!
It's after me!
It's all I know.
It's all I've been trained for. I have no intention of missing.
It's all close quarters now...
It's all comin' back to me.
It's all greed to me.
It's all over for you.
It's all over now.
It's all over the place!
It's all over. Our flametrooper is down. 
It's all these damn newcomers, gawking and squawking about.
It's almost done. 
It's almost over now, Kestis!
It's alright if you're not.
It's alright, Cal. Stand back. I will fix this.
It's alright, buddy.
It's alright, friend.
It's alright.
It's always a bit tough when I come back.
It's always a little strange seeing someone after being apart for years.
It's always something.
It's always up to me...
It's always worth a shot.
It's amazing being around you droids. You're history, you know that?
It's an abandoned research facility. Even bigger than the one in the forest.
It's an honor to fight by your side.
It's an honor to kill in the name of the Emperor.
It's an old temple used by pilgrims for thousands of years.
It's ancient. I feel connected to the people who used to live here.
It's arm came off so easily.
It's armor has been removed
It's as Cere said.
It's as if you don't want the treasure, frankly.
It's as we hoped.
It's beautiful here. I see why papa wanted to come.
It's beautiful!
It's beautiful.
It's because she reminds me of a fish.
It's been a long time since our days serving the Republic. I thought you were dead.
It's been a pleasure Senator. Hope this isn't the last time we get to do business together.
It's been a while since I tidied up, so good luck down there, kid.
It's been a while.
It's been de-shelled.
It's been far too long since I've made Greez's hair stand on end.
It's been forty years and that gossip hound still ain't satisfied. I wouldn't hold your breath.
It's been fun, Jedi.
It's been hard work. But once I understood my calling, I had to answer it.
It's been many years since I last took the life of a Jedi.
It's been too long, my pilot instincts are all off.
It's boring! When will we get some action? I want to put down some insurgents.
It's can't be!
It's catchy, they've got great taste. Why's that hard for you to admit?
It's changed you as well.
It's coming from that chamber.
It's coming right at us!
It's confused!
It's confused, take it down!
It's dangerous out there. I'd trust my own instincts over a fortune.
It's dead.
It's dead.
It's defenseless now.
It's definitely dead.
It's done.
It's done. Let's get this to Caij.
It's done...it's over.
It's done?
It's down.
It's easier to just dodge those.
It's easy if you just read it. 
It's easy to get knocked off course around here.
It's exposed - use it to our advantage!
It's exposed!
It's faint.
It's fake.
It's falling apart.
It's fine, I'm fine!
It's fine. I'll walk this off.
It's finished now.
It's flooded with Koboh matter.
It's funny not being able to see the sky.
It's go time, look alive.
It's going low.
It's going. Though you're fighting the Empire as much as I am.
It's gone now. We did it. 
It's gone.
It's gone. I think we did it.
It's gonna charge at us!
It's gonna take a lot to get Tanalorr ready for the others. Want to come with us?
It's good to acknowledge your fear.
It's good to see a friendly face.
It's good to see it so alive around the Reach. These people have been through a lot.
It's good to see you too. How are things around here?
It's good to see you.
It's good we're taking a pit stop.
It's good.
It's got to be those Purge Troopers stationed with us.
It's gotten me out of some bad situations, and I figured it might do the same for you.
It's handled.
It's hard to believe this paradise was hiding on just the other side of the Abyss!
It's hard to breathe. 
It's hard to stop suffering in this galaxy, but always worth the effort.
It's hard to tell how long one will last.
It's hidden somewhere in the Abyss.
It's him. 
It's home...
It's hopeless. We're goners.
It's how Bode reached us on Koboh.
It's in my programming.
It's in pieces and still goin'!?
It's in...two different places.
It's incredible.
It's incredible. It'd take years to see it all.
It's infuriating.
It's just - you can't beat them. Nobody can. We all live in that shadow.
It's just a big bug!
It's just an expressi- you know, nevermind. You're just a kriffin' droid.
It's just another target. Even we can deal with one target.
It's just as I told you.
It's just me and Kata, and that's about as much as I can handle these days.
It's just me.
It's just me? Oh...
It's just too damn busy around here these days!
It's just us now.
It's just you and me now.
It's just, I'm gonna miss this place.
It's like I can smell trouble.
It's like she saw into the future!
It's like that's all people want to talk about.
It's like the mountain doesn't want us here.
It's like they say, big wheel: there's only one way to train a deep-space pilot.
It's like they were trained by our people.
It's like you're...excuse me.
It's locked down.
It's locked.
It's locked. 
It's locked. 
It's locked. Or jammed. Or something.
It's looking pretty good.
It's lost its armor!
It's made the ground unstable.
It's me or you, Jedi!
It's my lucky day!
It's my pleasure, Cal. What a view!
It's my ship, ain't it?
It's never simple.
It's nice here, huh?
It's nice seeing you again, Merrin.
It's nice to finally patrol with an equal.
It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to see you.
It's nice.
It's nice. I like the plants. Nothing would grow on the base.
It's nice...
It's no Jedi trick.
It's no place for outlaws like us.
It's no use, BD.
It's not a contest.
It's not a tourist planet.
It's not about accuracy. It's about results: the end of the Jedi.
It's not defeat, it's just redirection.
It's not enough. 
It's not exactly what we expected.
It's not expensive. Just confidence.
It's not fighting on our side!
It's not him I'm worried about...
It's not just about getting out. It's about getting out before you lose everything.
It's not just you.
It's not like I've never been alone, either. Practically raised myself on an orbital mining station.
It's not luck. It's skill. At least, for me. 
It's not my fault if you don't remind me.
It's not my fault they got away!
It's not my fault. I just returned from patrol.
It's not on anyone.
It's not on you.
It's not over yet!
It's not over, Jedi. 
It's not responding.
It's not safe here. They will hurt you like they hurt me.
It's not safe here. You should get back to the Reach.
It's not so bad. 
It's not so tough.
It's not that easy, Kestis!
It's not that ugly in there.
It's not the same.
It's not too shabby. Lots of potential.
It's not your fault. But we must not let their deaths be in vain.
It's not your fault. We'll catch up with the yacht.
It's nothin'.
It's nothin'.
It's nothing.
It's okay, BD. We'll find another way.
It's okay, BD. You'll make new friends.
It's okay, Greez. You teach me when you think I'm ready.
It's okay, Sister.
It's okay, Toa. You don't have to defend a corrupt system.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. We're friends. What happened?
It's old, abandoned, and in the middle of nowhere.
It's on him.
It's on the move
It's on the other side of a deadly nebula called the Koboh Abyss.
It's only going to get harder to avoid them. Even on Koboh.
It's our duty as Imperial soldiers!
It's our job to trail you.
It's our mark!
It's our mark. Looks weak. 
It's out of control!
It's over for you!
It's over for you.
It's over now, Jedi!
It's over!
It's over!
It's over!
It's over!
It's over!
It's over, Kestis.
It's over, but that won't be the last of them.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over.
It's over. I did it.
It's over? And just when things were getting fun. 
It's over? He's dead? Good...
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
It's pointless, Jedi. 
It's pretty flexible.
It's priced like that for a reason.
It's probably nothing. Probably.
It's pulling me under.
It's quick.
It's quite alright. In this case, perhaps my impairment was quite the blessing.
It's quite hypnotic.
It's quite the play for Denvik.
It's quittin' time.
It's raining rockets!
It's real Greez.
It's really good seeing you again.
It's risky.
It's sand. It gets everywhere. Deal with it.
It's saved my life a couple times.
It's scarier now somehow.
It's sealed.
It's seen better days, that's for sure.
It's simple: we have our beliefs, the Jedi have theirs. One difference, though.
It's simply wonderful.
It's small, but still dangerous.
It's so agile!
It's so blue. But sometimes gray. Or purple. Orange. Wow.
It's so calm.
It's so difficult to imagine a galaxy without the Jedi. Like a drive core without its rhydonium spark.
It's so good that you're back in town, Mosey.
It's so good to see you, Merrin. What brings you to Jedha?
It's so hard to imagine.
It's so hot. I'm sweating through my clothes.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
It's some kind of electro dart?
It's some old tech in the tower that Dagan wants.
It's sounding great.
It's still standing.
It's strange seeing Jedi architecture again.
It's strong!
It's stuck.
It's stuck.
It's supposed to be loud. Not like you.
It's that Jedi!
It's that Jedi!
It's the Force user!
It's the Jedi I seek, and the thrill of that hunt.
It's the Jedi!
It's the Jedi!
It's the Jedi!
It's the Jedi!
It's the Jedi! After him!
It's the Jedi! After him!
It's the Jedi! Fire!
It's the Jedi! Get him!
It's the altitude. Lot of cloud cover this high up.
It's the best option I can see.
It's the ghost! Run for your lives!
It's the only explanation for my superior programming.
It's the others I worry about.
It's the shade, Cal. Of course, flora can grow in shade.
It's the unknown that spooks me, you know? All creakin' and abandoned. It's too quiet.
It's the unknown that spooks me, you know? All creaking and abandoned. It's too quiet.
It's the wealth. The sheer amount of credits flowing in and out of these streets.
It's the witch. Blast her!
It's this - was it that? No.
It's time to go. The Empire's closing in.
It's time to leave it behind.
It's time to set you free.
It's too dangerous for you here. You should go.
It's too far.
It's too fast!
It's too heavy.
It's too high up.
It's too late for that.
It's traitor hunting season!
It's unprotected!
It's up to me.
It's us against the galaxy, Cal. We've got to use every advantage we can find against the Empire.
It's us or them!
It's us or them.
It's useful. It's a tool.
It's very relaxing up there.

It's...a skriton.
It's...judging me.
It, uh, seems to be closing on me.
It...it isn't my place, Brother, but I must request clarification.
Its arm is off!
Its flower has a most unusual scent, drawn from the moss as it blooms. I find it quite pleasant. 
Its foliage shifts colors with the temperament. Quite dazzling. I wonder what color it will display on Koboh.
Its offensive capabilities diminish.
Its proximity to the archive is ideal.
Its sharpest thorns are right in the center, to defend against the most persistent predator.
Its shields could not stop that saber.
Its thick hide makes it resistant to even the strongest weapons.

Keep! Steady!
Keep... keep back!
Keep... keep your distance. 
Keep... keep your distance. 
Keepin' busy?
Keeping an eye on those two treasure hunters who just showed up.
Keeping on top of things?
Keeping so much of her power held back to achieve a larger goal.
Keeping the galaxy safe from threats is its own reward.
Keeps eyes on him. 
Keeps your blasters on him. 
Kehe! Keheheha...
Kestis has got to be contemplating his choices after that.
Kestis!
Kestis!
Kestis!
Kestis!
Kestis!
Kestis!
Kestis! Hold on, I'm coming.
Kestis!?
Kestis, don't make me wait.
Kestis, enough.
Kestis, putting the kibosh on the Raiders? Look at you!
Kestis, what are you doing?
Kestis.
Kestis...
Khri and Dagan...
Khri invented the Abyss compass to guide others safely to Tanalorr.
Khri must've locked down the facility when they evacuated. But that's not gonna stop us.
Khri's lab...
Kick it at his face!
Kid doesn't need our whole life story.
Kid's right, Dana. No more jobs on gang turf. Too risky with them Raiders!
Kid's right, dammit. Let's get outta here before we get worse than killed!
Kid, not now. I get the feeling Monk secretly turned this place from Pyloon's to Monk's!
Kill 'em all.
Kill confirmed.
Kill him already!
Kill him already!
Kill him already. 
Kill him before he wipes us out!
Kill him now!
Kill him now. 
Kill him now. 
Kill him quick!

Killing without a contract, what is this world coming to?
Kind of you to share.
Kinda looks like me.
Kinda makes me want to go now.
Kitchen looks in better shape than the rest of the ship, kid.
Kneel before me!
Kneel before the Empire!
Kneel to the Emperor!
Kneel, and I will deliver you a swift death.
Kneel, scum!
Kneel.
Knew I had a bad feeling about this job.
Knew we'd make it. Eventually.
Knight, or Padawan?
Knock 'em out!
Knock down initiated.
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Knocked out all their ranged units.
Knocked out rocket squad.
Know anything about that?
Know anything about the High Republic residences on Koboh?
Know how to use that?
Know pain!
Know who this was?
Know your place!
Koboh ain't exactly a bustling trade route. I stripped an old clunker in the gorge for parts.
Koboh born and raised!
Koboh has beautiful mornings, huh?
Koboh is full of surprises.
Koboh matter is burned, but there's more in there. Your grinder ready to go?
Koboh matter. It's overgrown.
Koboh was in the Empire's shadow long before that ship arrived. We will have to face them someday.
Koboh's a big planet...there's gotta be someone out there who thinks like me...
Koboh's about as remote as it gets. You chose well.
Koboh's pretty far from the nearest trade route. Looks like Greez makes do with salvage.
Koboh, good! Been meanin' to check up on Monk.
Koboh. If I'd known that planet would have so much drama, I would've started a cantina on Galidraan.
Koob and Lizz are probably starving by now.
Koob, Lizz, help Cal cross the gap.
Koob, Lizz, your turn!
Kriff that! Whatever we get out of this will be great, but I ain't dyin' for your grand utopia.
Kriff!
Kriff!
Kriff!
Kriff!
Kriff. That is just...ugh, kriff.
Kriffin' bugs!
Kriffin' thing's broken!
Kriffin'-!
Kriffin'-! I knew I should've asked for a blaster.
Kriffin--!
Kulkah!
Kung!
Lacking.
Lad! I've been admirin' all the fish we've added to ma tank...
Lad! Over here!
Lad! Yer alright! Och, what a burden off ma wee shoulders.
Laddie, did you know that I be a poet of sorts?
Laddie, look at this! The tank is abustle! A veritable fishy colony!
Lalala.
Landing hydraulics. We're a long way down.
Large beast here.
Large beast.
Large damage initiated.

Last big change here was when the cantina's old owner kicked the bucket.
Last chance to surrender.
Last chance, Caij!
Last clanker.
Last close quarters unit down. 
Last droid down. 
Last gunner down.
Last gunner down.
Last one, Kestis.
Last one.
Last patrol before shift change.
Last rocket trooper down.
Last seen high ground.
Last seen on higher ground.
Last time I checked, they ain't paying us by the step, so what do you care?
Last time I saw a Lucrehulk was Bracca - long time ago...
Lately I've had a real taste for Trandoshan funk.
Later, BD.
Later, Cal, I'm thinking of what to cook up for dinner.
Later, Cal. I need to run some diagnostics.
Later, Cal. There's much to do.
Later, Greez.
Later, kid.
Later.
Later.
Later.
Later. Now's not the time for words.
Laughable.
Laughter is light. But my time on Koboh grows short.
Launch it.
Launch!
Launching attack. 
Launching heavy attack.
Launching missile.
Launching ranged attack.
Launching!
Lay down covering fire!
Lay down covering fire. 
Lay down suppressing fire!
Lay down your weapons!
Lay off. I'm not in the mood.
Lay your eyes upon true power.
Lazy shootin'!
Lead the way, desert ghost.
Lead the way, scrapper.
Lead the way.
Learn a new trick?
Learn from his failure!
Learn from this. 
Learn how to fight with one first.
Learn to fight with honor.
Learn to fight, Jedi. 
Learn to fight.
Learn to protect yourself. I'm not responsible for you.
Learn to take a joke, droid.
Learn your place!
Learned one. To what do I owe the pleasure?
Learned that move from you!
Least it ain't hiding underground now.
Leave immediately, or you will be arrested!
Leave it to Greez to set up room for making bets.
Leave me alone, beast!
Leave me be, Jedi.
Leave me to my work.
Leave my equipment alone!
Leave on your own, or we take you in.
Leave some for me!
Leave some for me!
Leave some for me.
Leave some for me.
Leave that droid be!
Leave the cantina? I think not. They'll have to drag me out in a scrap box.
Leave the droids alone!
Leave the orders to me!
Leave this to me.
Leave this to me.
Leave those joints alone!
Leave us or share their fate.
Leaving so soon?
Leaving unauthorized.
Left my agents a note and hopped on the next transport to Kuat.
Left, right, left, right.
Left, right, left, right.
Leg joints shouldn't do that!
Legs are overrated.
Legs are required for locomotion.
Lemme go!
Lemme know if you need help.
Lemme look at'cha.
Lemme lower that exhaust tower so we can pull the ship in.
Lemme tell ya. I was one of the first people in this town. I've seen a lot of fads, flavors of the week.
Lend me a hand.
Less competition for me.
Less competition for the bounty.
Less said about that the better.
Less stalling, more trading.
Less talk, or you're next!
Less to get in my way.
Let 'em go, they don't matter.
Let 'em go. 
Let 'em have it.
Let death rain upon you!
Let death's spectre drive you.
Let get back on patrol.
Let go!
Let go!
Let her go!
Let him finish...
Let him go!
Let him go.
Let him go. We did our job. 
Let him run. We did our part. 
Let him run. We'll always find him. 
Let it guide you now.
Let it ride.
Let me GO, scum!
Let me at him!
Let me at him!
Let me at this thing!
Let me deliver your wretched demise.
Let me down!
Let me down!
Let me get a closer look.
Let me get a closer look.
Let me get this straight. You were held up by a rolling ball with spikes?
Let me go at once.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go, Jedi.
Let me go, or your friends will suffer.
Let me go, scum!
Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go. 
Let me guess, more prospecting equipment?
Let me guess, you forgot to marinate the fish before the broil?
Let me guess. Gulu and Gido?
Let me guess. You're staying too.
Let me kill this pest.
Let me know if you need anything.
Let me know if you need help.
Let me know if you need help.
Let me make this eminently clear:
Let me offer you a piece of advice, for when that Jedi rolls on through here.
Let me prepare a data stick so you'll have access to our research wherever your journey takes you.
Let me see if I can't talk them round.
Let me see your power, Jedi!
Let me see.
Let me see. Oh! Three-hundred, thirty-eight thousand, two hundred and seven.
Let me take care of this. 
Let me thank you in advance for my career promotion.
Let me through, and I'll put in a good word with Denvik.
Let me through, now.
Let me through, or I'll report you to Denvik for insubordination.
Let my fury find its mark!
Let others see what happened here.
Let our blades decide!
Let that be a lesson - don't mess with Merrin!
Let that be a lesson to y'all. You come into my outpost...
Let that be a lesson to you. Keep your distance unless you want to end up like him!
Let that be your reward.
Let the Inquisitors know.
Let the Jedi come. His death means victory for our cause at last.
Let the battle begin!
Let the boss deal out the punishment. The Haxion Brood ain't got room for cowards.
Let the hunt continue!
Let them come, I'm not afraid. I'll make short work of whatever comes in range.
Let them come.
Let them run. 
Let this be a lesson to the Empire!
Let this be a reminder of what happens when you cross the Bedlam Raiders!
Let this be a test!
Let us end this.
Let us end your treacherous Empire!
Let us exchange.
Let us fight, Cere.
Let us fight. 
Let us go, Jedi.
Let us go.
Let us go.
Let us leave.

Let us speak later, noble one.

Let's adjust our aim.

Let's see how that works out.
Let's see how this beast fights.
Let's see how tough this thing is.
Let's see how well you fly.
Let's see how you do.
Let's see how you use that.
Let's see how you wield it.
Let's see if 3490's squad finds something. And if anyone turns back up, we'll be here to check their documentation.
Let's see if Doma is interested in this.
Let's see if anyone at the outpost is interested in this.
Let's see if they know how to use 'em.
Let's see now...

Let's show 'em!
Let's show him what we dug up.
Let's show this to Zee.
Let's show this to the Anchorites.

Let's split up. I will slow their progress, we'll regroup near the temple.
Let's stay alert. We need to find that lab.
Let's stay off the sand, buddy. Don't want to end up a snack.
Let's stop for a moment.
Let's stop here.
Let's stop.
Let's switch it up, BD.
Let's take 'em down.
Let's take 'em down.
Let's take a break, boy.

Let's talk in a little while.
Let's talk later Cal, yeah?
Let's talk later.
Let's talk later.
Let's talk once we're rid of this impressively bloodthirsty beast, eh?
Let's teach it a lesson.
Let's test the weight balance.
Let's travel together, then. It is a long road to Pilgrim's Sanctuary.
Let's try again.
Let's try again.
Let's try combining both panels together in front of that diamond shape.
Let's try giving you some help.
Let's try luring one of those roller mines closer to the dam.
Let's try not to end up like that guy.
Let's try some other components.
Let's try that again, BD.
Let's try that cable, it should raise the crane.
Let's try this again.
Let's try this again.
Let's try this one.
Let's try this!
Let's try this.
Let's try this.
Let's try to avoid unnecessary attention.

Lets...let's not be hasty.
Level 2046 has seen better days.
Level one? This place is bigger than it looks.
Lies! Who said that?
Lies.
Lies.
Life from death!
Life has this funny way of forcing you on the path forward.
Life here was already hard before the Raiders came, but now? Ugh.
Life is precious.
Life is stubborn like that, I suppose.
Life signs null.
Life's like cooking a meal. Sure, you make mistakes, but you can't just start over.

Like Greez said, nice shooting back there.
Like I care. You're putting us both in danger. 
Like I need B2s backing me up. 
Like I need backup to kill you.
Like I said, I'm not looking to start a career in bounty hunting.
Like I said, blaster poisoning.
Like I was saying, if we want to change things we've got to tear it down and start over.
Like Tanalorr, yeah?
Like a Jedi of old!
Like a TIE Fighter slamming into a mountain!
Like a bantha to the slaughter.
Like a bolt in a scrap yard...
Like a fish! Like the nose of a bony fish. She had three great claws -
Like a rock.
Like a shadow you can't shake.
Like a sky full of grinnin' stars!
Like a womp rat in a vent shaft.
Like all things, once understood, it can be channeled and thus controlled.
Like an Imperial cavity search. But I've got to admit, it's great to see everyone excited.
Like being home.
Like everything else around here.
Like friends.
Like hunting rondats.
Like most good things, it all started with a dream. The vision of one sharp-eyed Waluna named Doma Dendra.
Like old times.
Like old times.
Like old times.
Like one, not the other.
Like playing holochess with a blurrg.
Like rats in a maze. I don't like it.
Like rats in a maze. I don't like it.
Like showing off do you?
Like that'll work.
Like the focus.
Like the new look?
Like the wind.
Like this cantina. Someone ordering a drink from Monk. A joke from Gulu. A hunting tale from Mosey.
Like this!
Like to keep your head on a swivel in a new locale, eh? I can respect that.
Like what the Empire did to the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
Like what you see?
Like what?

Listen, I...I'm sorry that -
Listen, friend - what's your name?
Listen, holobooks are full of tyrants that spread from system to system like wildfire.
Listen, if the Empire traces those relics to this region, they might suspect something.
Listen, just grab Zee and skedaddle before the whole hive comes swarming down on you, hmm?
Listen, just let me fuss, would ya?
Listen, now that we're partners...
Listen, the Empire's not gonna be happy to find you out here. Why don't you head back to the Reach?
Listen, the Imps are like investors: you can only keep them in the dark for so long.
Listen, the happiest folk live somewhere between what they want and what they got, y'know?
Listen, tin can. I ain't giving my life for some stinkin' droid, got it!?

Maybe you'd like to cut the chatter and keep your eyes out for hostiles.
Maybe you're just too tall.
Maybe you're one of them.
Maybe you're right about that.
Maybe you're right. Distracted personnel are the third highest cause of fatalities.
Maybe your little droid can use this encrypted backup code to get it open?
Maybe, but I'd keep my home base here of course.
Maybe, but it proves a point.
Maybe, but it's just like the prospectors say: better a broken pick than a rusted one.
Maybe, but keep it to yourself.
Maybe, but my point is they don't even know to use Mon Cala sea salt in a Kibla green salad.
Maybe, but the Empire doesn't hunt you down for using a jetpack.

Maybe. She mostly keeps to herself, to be honest.
Maybe. Think the Jedi's alive?
Maybe. Yeah, one of us has to keep fighting.
Me and Cal, ah, we go way back. Way back. He's not so bad, once you get to know him.
Me appearance, lad. Does it warm yer shallows? Does it put a sea-spray on yer face?
Me neither.
Me neither.
Me too!
Me too! I want a real shot at taking down someone like that!
Me too, Zee.
Me too, and I don't like anybody!
Me too.
Me too.
Me too.
Me too. But just don't go starting a witch school or something.
Me too. Grandma Pyloon's cooking lives on! But the loth-cats...not so much.
Me too. Hey Monk. Good work here.
Me too. Me too.
Me too. Me too.
Me too. Of course, we both started making fun of 'Clumsy Rumsy'. I laughed at Gulu's zingers.
Me too. The air is fresh here. Not like on the base.
Me, uh, with kids, no, no. I mean well, yeah. Yeah, okay. No. No, wait. What was the question?
Me.
Me?
Me? I would, but...I'm busy, okay?
Me? I've been on Koboh for most of my life.
Me? No.
Me? Oh no, no...no. It's just...I've never seen anyone like her before.
Me? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Me? [laugh] Not a chance.
Meager.
Meaning your legs still work?
Meaning?
Meaningless Jedi.
Meaningless resistance.
Means a lot coming from you.
Measured strength overcomes all.
Meatbag eliminated.
Meddling in the affairs of other cults will bring only ruin, Sister.
Medical assistance administered. 
Medicine. Surgery. Healing.
Mediocre.
Meditating, actually.
Meet him in battle!
Meet ya back at the Mantis.
Meet your death.
Meet your fate, Kestis!
Melee bludgeon.
Melee support down.
Melee support down. Keep steady. 
Melee unit, move in.
Melee units are finished.
Melee units are gone.
Melee units destroyed!
Melee units down!
Melted straight through it!
Mentally reciprocating high five.
Merciless!
Merciless. 
Mercy is not in my programming, only victory.
Merely a slip.
Merited.
Merrin
Merrin - can I get a boost?
Merrin and Greez haven't made it back to the ship yet.
Merrin and I are gonna head into the desert. Save an Anchorite from the Empire.
Merrin could've warned us about those.
Merrin had the upperhand all along!
Merrin knows how to fight!
Merrin knows the fastest route there. Just be careful not to draw the Empire back to the archive.
Merrin knows the score and gets the score!
Merrin mentioned this was the back route, right?
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin! Can you hear me?
Merrin! Merrin!
Merrin! We're coming!
Merrin's a Nightsister.
Merrin's always on the move, exploring new places. Making new friends.
Merrin's been keeping busy.
Merrin's decided to join us.
Merrin's wasted no time getting comfy on the Mantis.
Merrin's watching out for us, buddy.
Merrin's...one of a kind.
Merrin, I need you to stay here and defend the Mantis.
Merrin, can you--
Merrin, could we go exploring sometime?
Merrin, didn't know you were coming. Maybe I'll pick up some scazz steaks.
Merrin, help!
Merrin, now!
Merrin, now.
Merrin, right?
Merrin, will you teach me how to fight someday?
Merrin, you got it?
Merrin, you heard him, right?
Merrin, you're alright.
Merrin.
Merrin.
Merrin.
Merrin?
Merrin?
Merrin? She's a good friend. What about her?
Merrin? What was the look?
Merrin? You can come out. I won't hurt you.
Merrin?! Where'd she run off to...
Metal above, mist below. We take shelter in the in-between.
Might Be Tough
Might I suggest instead, a Bloody Rancor?
Might as well plant some of these seeds.
Might be a good idea to get some extra muscle. Protect our investment, ya know?
Might be below us.
Might be enough to get the sluice gates going.
Might be!
Might even help you blend in a little.
Might have a venture for ya later.
Might just be Greez's stew talking, but this place is beginning to grow on me.
Might make it all stand out.
Might not be able to cook like you, but we were able to find food.
Might take an excursion today.
Might wanna be careful with that.
Might wanna run!
Might wanna run!
Might want to check the locks on that door.
Mind a couple of passengers, big girl?
Mind giving me a closer look?
Mind if I take a few shots with that E-5 rifle of yours? Always wanted to try out rapid fire mode.
Mind if I take a look?
Mind if we catch a lift?
Mind if we join you?
Mind if we ride along, boy?
Mind lending me your rifle?
Mind that beak.
Mind the ranged offense.
Mind the ricochet.
Mind your business.
Mind your feet. Its spray attack will leave pools of acid on the ground.
Mind your own business.
Mind your sensors!
Mind your sensors!
Mind your tone. Loyal Imperial troopers died in this crash.
Mind yourself out there.
Mind yourself.
Mine is redemption for our friends. If not for Kata, I know what I would do.
Mine is to blast a Jedi. Right in the face.
Mine now, Jedi!
Mine too!
Mine's been broken since the crash.
Mine's okay. Thanks for the warning.
Mining is hard.
Miserable machine.
Misery. And maybe treasure, or so I hear. If you're in the area, could be worth a visit.
Miss me, BD?
Miss me?
Missed again.
Missed again.
Missed me!
Missed me!
Missed me.
Missed your mark.
Missed!
Missed.
Missed.
Missed.
Missiles neutralized.
Missing Coruscant. The Temple. My cramped room...
Mission success. Let's head back. 
Mist and more mist, and all manner of danger prowling within.
Mm, I've visited countless libraries and transcribed many an ancient text.
Mm, but you've stayed the same?
Mm, depends. What are we talking about?
Mm, don't care. Run along now.
Mm, masterfully played.
Mm, no.
Mm, that's some serious firepower.
Mm-hm!
Mm-hm. Abandoned my label, my penthouse, the promise of fame, all of it.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm. A shame.
Mm. But let's have some fun too, right?
Mm. Explain...
Mm. Hello.
Mm. Just fills me to the brim with confidence.
Mm. Same way Garra gots up.
Mmm hmm.
Mmm hmm. Droid from the High Republic days.
Mmm hmm. I'll believe it when I see it.
Mmm hmm. I'm onto you, Kestis.
Mmm, can't wait.
Mmm, just a pawn. Do you carry a communication device?
Mmm, maybe I don't really want to find out.
Mmm, nothing I can figure. All's well here at Pyloon's Saloon.
Mmm, the chase.
Mmm...Mygeeto casserole.
Mmm...nope.
Mmmmm, execute.
Mobile target.
Mobility impaired.
Mocking Turgle's like drinking water.
Modded mine in Coronet City, pretty sure it's illegal.
Modded my blasters myself, to boost my close game.
Model Number B2-15051989.
Modifying to solo execution
Mogu approaching.
Mogu are actually pretty rare... and pretty lethal!
Mogu detected.
Mogu spotted.
Mogu, we have a mogu here!
Mogu? Mogu!
Mon Cala. It is vibrant, clean, bursting with energy. The people were welcoming and kind.
Monitoring for hostiles.
Monk and I picked it up from the previous owner through a - well, a - well...
Monk calls it cluttered. Well, I say this is cozy!
Monk lets me keep my things in the back room. Go on, see if anything suits your fancy.
Monk makes 'em strong.
Monk mentioned you met in a sabaac den?
Monk told me what transpired while I was asleep.
Monk's been busy! And from the sound of that sweet ride outside, so have you.
Monk's been really busy.
Monk's out of Gamorrean bitters.
Monk, I could really use a drink!
Monk, I must know. What befell the Jedi Order?
Monk, we're about to take off. Don't know when we'll be back. If we'll be back.
Monk, you back there?
Moon Array, aligned.
Moon Lab
Mooo, toh. Shasoo.
Moooove!
Moran, Moran, did you hear what happened!?
Moran, you've got an eye for business ventures, right?
Moran. Charmed.
More High Republic data.
More Imperials by the day. Looks like the party's over before it even began.
More Imps ahead.
More Jedi sorcery.
More are bound to be on the way.
More are coming.
More brutality.
More carnage!
More coming in from the surface!
More coming! I'll peel off, draw a few away.

More conflict, more death. As long as the Empire remains.

More imperials up ahead!
More is required, then.
More jobs like this and I'll make commander in no time.
More junk for the scrappers.
More like twice the trouble.
More of 'em!
More of that coming.
More of that stuff from the forest.
More of that, huh?
More of you.
More of you. So the Raiders are up to something down here.
More or less.
More or less. Not that I didn't go down swinging.
More people means more networking opportunities.
More pests to slaughter.
More priorite. 
More priorite. Wonder what this'll fetch at Doma's shop.
More ruthless than anticipated.
More scraps, huh? Leave it to Greez to take another person's junk and... add more junk.
More skilled than I thought.

More, ever more!
More, more!

More, more!
More, more, more!
More.
Morning.
Mortality probable.
Mosey said you might be trouble, but I'm not so sure.
Mosey says you went head-to-head with a mogu. Now that's something even I wouldn't try!
Mosey told me you took out a bilemaw! Gutsy!
Mosey was right. This thing was nasty.
Mosey'll take care of it.
Mosey's prices might put you off.
Most days it feels like it happened to someone else.
Most did nae believe what I'd seen - they say she was naught but the terminal spasm of a starving salt's brain.
Most do not survive encountering Jedi. You are fortunate that I am here.
Most droids aren't even welcome in establishments like this. You my friend are an old softy with a heart of gold.
Most frustrating.
Most hunters know you cull when you need to, and you stop hunting when a herd gets too low.
Most impressive.
Most of these scraps are slashed to bits, won't be pretty, but they'll do the trick.
Most of these scraps are slashed to bits, won't be pretty, but they'll do the trick.
Most optimal patrol routes. It's this one.
Most people are on the outside. Even if they don't know it.
Most shop owners would offer a discount or the like, but not me.
Most things in this galaxy are out our control.
Mother of moons, that's a relief! I'm useless in a fight.
Motion, however, can provide clarity. Let truth flow like a river, and carve new channels around any obstacle.
Motor functions erratic!
Mount can't reach us here.
Mount up!
Mount won't reach us here.
Mountain Array, aligned.
Mountain's not safe, stranger. I'd just watch where you go snoopin' around.
Move along now.
Move along. I have no interest in consorting with the likes of you.

Mph! Oh, muckle sorry, laddie. Ye startled me.
Mr. Avalanche? No thank you!
Mu! Mu! Shosho na! Abootay!
Much appreciated.
Much better.
Much better. Much, much better...
Much blood has been shed in this desert. And more will, so long as the Empire remains.
Much has changed since we last saw each other.
Much improved, Cal, now that I am far from that ghastly ship.
Much more useful than a jetpack.
Much of the terrain is occluded. Ambushes are highly likely.
Much on the mind...much to do...
Much.
Multiple wounds identified.
Munitions are no match for the Force.
Munitions out.
Music is a distraction, we have more important things to focus on.
Music's what got me through my scrapping days on Bracca.
Must I?
Must be delayed.
Must be getting close to Greez by now.
Must be getting closer.
Must be hard, being away from her.
Must be interesting to be a droid.
Must be something inside.
Must be something worth defending.
Must be that ringing in my ears. The other day, a roller mine blew up, nearly took my head off!
Must be the place Gulu told us about.
Must be tiring.
Must be why they call you Jo the Cannibal.
Must feel good to get back in the cockpit after so long.
Must have been thriving here, once.
Must have something to do with their research on Koboh.
Must not get a lot of business here.
Must not have left much of an impression.
Must've been dangerous.
Must've been here for centuries.
Must've been tough in the beginning.
Must've left a trail somewhere.
My Anchorites have taken to following him around. Doting on him. Bringing him tokens of respect.
My B2!
My Padawan is impatient.
My advice. When it's on the rampage, get out of the way or it'll flatten ya.
My aim is true. 
My analysis indicates a lower than expected chance of victory against a Jedi.
My armaments are at the ready.
My armor could use a polish.
My armor holds.
My armor was designed to withstand heavy blaster fire.
My armor won't last against that.
My associate and I appreciate your help. We'll see you back at Pyloon's.
My assumption was that these Raiders were unprincipled thieves and brutes.
My attack was stopped.
My bad.
My barrier is down!
My barrier is gone.
My barrier's down.
My battle droids!
My battle fury is awakened!
My belief is what will carry us through this patrol.
My biometric scans tell me I should not trust you.
My blaster can't do that.
My blaster goes off one time -
My blaster is ready.
My blaster was malfunctioning earlier. Hopefully it's fixed now.
My blaster will likely jam. It always jams.
My blaster's jammed. They gave me faulty tech!
My body won't move. 
My bones are telling me trouble is near.
My brother, you are lethal!
My calculations show our odds of success in this conflict are approximately 9.73%.
My client's pockets are far deeper than yours, scum.
My credits are on 'surprisingly few'.
My credits are on Santari Khri.
My credits are on another dry day.
My crew.
My databank contains no memory of a crash.
My desires are purely violent.
My despair is for you. Tanalorr has changed you.
My devotion is pure. My ascension surely nears.
My devotion is pure. My ascension surely nears.
My door's always open, Cal.
My droid!
My droideka! Why you!
My droids are not for racing.
My droids! You kriffin' gundark!
My duel with the Gen'Dai didn't take this long.
My ears are pounding.
My elder sisters taught me that death is simply a veil we all must pass through.
My employer was the type who would never have let me quit, if you catch my meaning.
My every action is in service of the Empire.
My eyes what they are, I couldn't hit a tree with a boulder - but I got ears like a bulabird!
My favorite. Can't wait.
My filter isn't equipped for this!
My filter isn't...filtering.
My filter...appears to be broken...
My focus has, and always will be, the murderous Jedi I seek to eradicate. 
My footing!
My freedom is bought with your blood.
My friend here tells me she spotted you in Imperial territory. I'm impressed you made it back.
My friend might be interested. He runs Pyloon's Saloon.
My friends - is this the inaugural meeting for the Koboh party planning committee?
My friends, I will not live to see all the wonders of this desert.
My friends, did you see them?
My friends, it is good to see you.
My friends, it is good to see you.
My friends, it is time to head to the ancient site at the center of this desert.
My friends, it is time to visit the ancient site at the center of this desert.
My fury grows!
My genius has paid off again.
My goodness, you unlocked it! Feel free to take whatever you can make use of.
My great-grandma. Taught me everything I know about cooking.
My guard is strong.
My guard persists.
My guard won't break.
My hand won't falter!
My hand!
My hands are still shaking.
My height is irrefutable design.
My helmet's got a smudge on the visor. Might be hard to blast. 
My home and they just expected me to throw it away!
My hunting blaster malfunctioned!
My incurable honesty.
My jetpack could use a tune-up.
My jetpack is damaged.
My jetpack!
My jetpack!
My jetpack!
My jetpack!
My jetpack!
My jetpack's busted!
My jetpack's inoperable.
My journey ends here.
My journey is nearly at its end.   When I look back I see suffering and sadness, yes, but also joy and friendship.
My kind...
My legend grows!
My legend grows!
My legs are gonna ache after this.
My life is a series of fires and blaster fights. It all blurs together.
My life?
My magick has kept us safe for now.
My mama did. She had this one plant. She'd water it every day.
My mama used to sing it to me when I was little.
My man, one is never enough.
My manufacture date was five cycles before the Clone Wars.
My master always frowned upon using blasters.
My master always said, 'The foolish one lies awake worrying about what he cannot change.'
My master is good friends with Santari Khri. She recommended him.
My master was her Padawan.
My master. Every time I fell, he got me back on my feet.
My memory banks are coming up short, Cal, but it is surely the work of Master Khri.
My mineral sorter keeps short circuiting.
My model has rockets.
My model is faster than you.
My model is stronger than you.
My momma gave him to me.
My name is Dagan Gera. Your attack here has failed and your soldiers' lives are forfeit.
My name's Dana. My friend Grock here is in a mood.
My new Order will have no place for the weak.
My new programming has made me unstoppable!
My nickname for you. "Little tinny".
My oath is fulfilled. I thank you.
My oath shall be undone by flame!
My oath will be fulfilled in blood!
My objective is to defeat enemies. Your safety is not guaranteed.
My odds aren't good...
My oh my, this is fun.
My old scrapper outfit. Why did Greez keep this?
My olfactory sensors appear to be offline.
My olfactory sensors are not calibrated to detect wildlife.
My olfactory sensors can detect up to four hundred distinct odors at once. You'll have to be more specific.
My only directive is to kill you. I will not fail.
My orders are not to become part of any stories.
My orders are to hunt and crush Jedi. You do as I say.
My other squad was wiped out.
My owners had relatives, on Onderon. I will seek them out.
My pack!
My pack!
My pack's trashed!
My parents were not Narkis, nor were they native to Jedha - but I was born here.
My passion strengthens me.
My patience is waning. 
My patience wears thin.
My patience with your faulty programming wears thin. Be silent.
My people don't dance. The dance is my people. All together. Without everyone's essence, there is nothing.
My photoreceptor is malfunctioning.
My position is right here!
My power levels are already at 50%
My power levels are nearly depleted.
My programming does not require socialization to achieve optimal performance.
My programming forbids desertion. So...no.
My programming is efficient and singular.
My programming is superior.
My programming will prevail.
My reflexes are too fast.
My research indicates they have no hearts! Barely anything more than a nervous system.
My saloon better be okay, Turgle! I think you brought this down on us!
My search commences. 
My search for the Zeffo took me off the radar of the Council.
My secret dies with you.
My sensors are superior, yet you are correct.
My shield is broken!
My shield is down!
My shield is just gone!
My shield is supposed to keep you away.
My shield!
My shield!
My shield's been destroyed!
My shield's gone!
My shield...just left?
My signal receiver is malfunctioning.
My sincerest appreciation to those who have tread this path before me.
My sisters taught me that to discuss a spell is to unravel it. So let us let this one lie for now.
My skill is superior.
My specialty!
My speeder is this way.
My stance is solid. 
My strategic subroutines are primed.
My strength is boundless!
My strength will aid me. 
My systems can play some patrol music.
My thoughts are clouded...
My thoughts are...clouded.
My thoughts exactly.
My thoughts exactly.
My time to shine.
My time to shine. 
My training is irrelevant. I'll beat them with sheer force of will!
My training is paying off.
My training will aid me.
My training won't fail me. 
My troops will beat you. 
My turn!
My turn!
My turn.
My turn.
My turn.
My turn.
My uniform's not even dusty.
My victory was always assured.
My village told me I'd be the one tae save them from the Great Fish Famine.
My vision is impaired.
My visor gets fogged up pretty easily, but I'll do my best.
My visor has been malfunctioning lately. Sub-standard gear.
My weapon!
My weapons are also operational.
My weapons are cooling down.
My weapons must recharge.
My wife... [inhale]
My will's stronger than that armor!
My wings are clipped!
My wings!
My wings!
My work became a passion and I soon...stumbled upon an innovation.
My wound ain't healed!
My, just look at it.
My, my. Very impressive.
My, oh my!
My, that's a feisty personality you're running with. But no, I do not.
Myself.
N-20 Baradium core.
N-NO!
N-no!!
N-not possible!
Nah, I'm on to new things, Turgle.
Nah, but they might keep us alive a little longer.
Nah, cool your jets. I'm sure it's nothing.
Nah, nevermind. I'll be okay. Forget I asked.
Nah, she'll hold.
Nah, this is what the old man woulda wanted. Call it my bereavement tax.
Nah, this is what the old man woulda wanted. Call it my bereavement tax.
Nah, you'd be surprised!
Nah, you're all dead!
Nah.
Nah. Last I heard, Cere was holed up in the desert with some weird hermits called Anchorites.
Nah. She never told me. And I never asked.
Nailed it, Cal!
Naive? I don't know the meaning of the word!
Nak off!
Name's Caij Vanda.
Name's Dana. The old geezer's called Grock.

Navigate the Koboh Abyss.
Naw aw.
Nay! I cannae succumb to the passions o' the stomach - the garpon must live!
Nay: dangerous fish tae catch a...spot!
Ne'er a more fearsome ship did ye clamp eye on. She was sharp, like a...like...
Near' is not 'on'.
Nearly done with this patrol route.
Nearly time for some rations, I think.
Nearly.
Neat trick, buddy.
Necessary sacrifices for the cause, if you ask me.
Need a break already?
Need a break, scummer?
Need a break. 
Need a hand with 'em?
Need a jolt here, buddy. 
Need a jolt here.
Need a moment? 
Need a pick-me-up.
Need a second!
Need a stim!
Need a stim!
Need a target, Cal!
Need an assist!
Need me to repair anything?
Need more time!
Need some help here. 
Need some help?
Need to be quicker this time.
Need to be quicker.
Need to be quicker.
Need to center myself.
Need to charge this. 
Need to check out these new droids.
Need to follow protocol. 
Need to move closer.
Need to open this. 
Need to overcharge this. 
Need to reload. 
Need to slice this. 
Need you to charge this, BD. 
Need your stims, huh?

Needless B1 eliminated.
Negative, that would violate my programming.
Negative, trooper. Just stay behind the force field.
Negative.
Negative.
Negative.
Negative.
Negative. 
Negative. Call it in.
Negative. Don't touch that vessel. The crash site is unstable.
Negative. Hardly a threat.
Negative. Hold position.
Negative. I am your superior. Not you.
Negative. I will destroy.
Negative. It reveals our position.
Negative. That would violate protocol.
Negative. They're meant to be obeyed.
Negative. This force field can withstand anything these locals throw at it.
Negative. Used my last one on the cultists.
Negative. We've got our orders. 
Neither can I. We will honor them by helping the Path, Cal.
Neither do I.
Neither does mine.
Neither have I.
Nek! Shoo tooka!
Nekkos are local to Koboh. And I've known Brutus here since I landed.
Nekkos can't reach us here.
Neutralize the enemy, trooper. It is your duty.
Neutralize the target. 
Neutralize the threat at once.
Neutralize them.
Neutralizing
Neutralizing threat.
Never Heard It
Never a moment to rest.
Never been in a senator's ship before. Blew one up, once. Good times.
Never been to Jedha. We headed to the city?
Never change, Moran.
Never did like that noise they made.
Never did think what happened to them Jedi was fair. But then, this galaxy ain't ever been fair.
Never doubted you!
Never expected I'd kill one of these myself.
Never fails. I sure do know you B1s.
Never forget, the Emperor expects you to go above and beyond in his service.
Never get old.
Never got to ride one.
Never kill a Raider.
Never kill a Raider.
Never killed a Jedi. Always a first time.
Never learn, do we?
Never learn, do you?
Never mess with the Brood.
Never mind.
Never put the time into it.
Never rely on a droid.
Never seen 'em like that.
Never seen a droideka like that.
Never seen a species like that before.
Never seen anything cut through one of those!
Never seen that before.
Never seen that before. 
Never seen the boss so quiet. Feels like you two have some scores to settle.
Never seen this one. I should talk to Pili about it.
Never send a droid to do a soldier's job!
Never send an organic to do a synthetic's job.
Never thought I'd be the last one standing. 
Never thought I'd feel this...
Never thought I'd have to fight a MagnaGuard...
Never thought I'd see a Jedi. It's exciting! I wonder how much those lightsabers can really cut through.
Never too late to try something new.
Never took them. I was knighted in the field.
Never trusted you droids. No loyalty, only programming.
Never, then.
Never.
Never. It is embarrassing. 
Never. That decision was correct at the time. This is how I choose to live.
Nevertheless, I have observed it.
New hostile located.
New location Shattered Moon.
New look for you BD. Same great attitude!
New seeds. Bet Pili will have something to say about this.
New seeds. Magnificient. After you've planted one, I'll share what I know.
New tactical challenges await you.
New threat detected. Eliminating.
Newcomer!
Newcomers are opportunities for profit.
Newest report says we've been losing a lot of patrols lately.
News this good? It's infectious. The Raiders sent packing, Pyloon's full of fresh patronage...
Next let's go to...
Next one won't miss.
Next shot's your last.
Next stop, Koboh's moon.
Next stop, kiddo - the shattered moon of Koboh!
Next thing I know, I swear I hear roarin', carried by this unnatural warm wind. Horrific!
Next time use cover.
Next time you wanna pick a fight, you go through us.
Next time!
Next time, Jedi. Next time.
Next time, aim. 
Next time, aim. 
Next time, maybe run a scan before you start firing.
Next time, put him down!
Next time, tackle him!
Next to Cere, he's the best marksman I've ever met.
Next?
Ngh! [struggle]
Ngh. [sigh]
Nghh.
NiJedha? Yes, but it is too dangerous for frequent visits.

Nice work. The Empire will be happy. 
Nice!
Nice!
Nice, Cal!
Nice, managed to slip past that one.
Nice, seeds. Bet Pili can tell us more after we plant them.
Nice, you've got an open mind. Most folks just stick with the old standards or cater to the Imperial censors.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice.
Nice. 
Nice. I think.
Nice. Looks intact.
Nice. They offered me that position too, but I didn't want to leave my post. 
Nice. This'll come in handy later.
Nicely done!
Nicely done!
Nicely done.
Nicely done.
Night market. He was trying to buy a crate of electro-proton bombs from a Chagrian arms dealer.
Nights black as quellfish innards, winters so cold a stern look could turn ye to glass.
Nightsister.

No armor can stand up to that lightsaber.
No beast can best our foe.
No beast can best you.
No beast can stand against him.
No beast can stop you, huh!?
No better place to be, with chaos rising everywhere else.
No blaster in my face. No spilling drinks and shouting bloody murder. Cute droid, too.
No bounty hunters.
No bounty today...
No bounty.
No bounty. You risked your life for free?
No bug's gonna bring down a Jedi
No can do. Every step I take sounds like a rancor's in there gnawing on my bones.
No chains for you. Just death.
No challenge for him.
No chance!

No idea. Never seen anything like 'em.
No intruders detected. Should we report in?
No job ever goes according to plan, does it?
No kiddin'.
No kidding.
No kidding.
No kidding. Beautiful specimen. Was gonna leave well enough alone.
No kidding. But once you find the right person, it gets easier.
No kidding. How close did you get?
No kidding. I can't imagine.
No kidding. If she sent Zee to that bacta tank, maybe there's more to this story.
No kidding. It's been years. You must've seen the entire galaxy.
No kidding. Just like that old droid, huh?
No kidding. This thing's gotta have a weakness.
No kidding. Toa took a real shine to Zee. Here I thought only bolt heads like me got attached to droids.
No kidding. Why else would he throw his top slicer into the rancor's maw?
No lift platform here.
No look. Just a greeting.
No luck, BD.
No man or droid is taking that thing down.
No match for a Jedi.

No matter how painful the memories.
No matter the outcome, you will do your duty to the Empire that made you.
No matter what I did, where I planted it, how I treated the soil, it refused to grow.
No matter where, I'll be ready. Blaster primed and sights focused! Bring it on.
No matter!
No matter, but I think she would have liked you!
No matter, no matter!
No matter. Ghost or not, I'd like to see something go toe-to-toe with the new assault craft.
No matter. Jedi, or not, Kili hunts his targets all the same. And not a single one's escaped.

No pain will stop me. 
No pain, huh? We'll see about that.
No patching up that droid
No point in hidin'!
No power!
No problem!
No problem, Toa.
No problem, we've got a whole swarm of them up ahead.
No promises.

No rush at all.
No rush, but uh, hurry up and let us know when you're on your way back.
No scanning, okay, BD?
No shame, mate! You ain't the first to visit Koboh and end up staying for good.
No shell can stop a saber, huh?
No sign of Brother Armias.

No! Not yet!
No! Stop!
No! Stop!
No! They're loaded. Filthy rich.
No! We engage the target and wait for backup.
No! You can't leave!
No! You don't say?
No! You're just annoying me.
No!?
No!?
No, Cal. If I had, I would have contacted you.
No, Captain. Sector is secured.
No, I believe you.
No, I didn't.
No, I don't.
No, I guess not.
No, I need you, Cal!
No, I still should have been able to -
No, I suppose you can't.
No, I think I'd remember that detail.
No, I think it's probably worse than that.
No, I'm afraid my slumber didn't afford me much of a vantage.
No, I'm not one of those fools.
No, I'm sorry - I seem to have forgotten asking for your pity.
No, I've got better things to think about. Do you think about that?
No, I...can't. You're not authorized.
No, Jedi!
No, Jedi!
No, Koboh.
No, Senator.
No, absolutely not.
No, an excavation team.
No, and she seems exceptionally driven by this particular task.
No, apparently prospectors left when nobody struck it rich.
No, but -
No, but BD was with the Mantis. They are evacuating those they can.
No, but I have heard Imps talking of a new excavation machine.
No, but I helped capture one. They got what they deserved and so will this one.
No, but I love the cuisine. Anytime I see a Latero dish on the menu, I'm a happy man.
No, but I was a little busy at the time.
No, but it's my business as a bartender to size up my clientele, whether they be debtors, buzz boys, or troublemakers.
No, but what does it matter?
No, but, I don't think that's relevant.
No, don't let him run!
No, everyone left! It's just us and the dregs of Koboh, present company excluded of course.
No, his bounty's mine!
No, it did not.
No, it isn't.
No, it was nothing like a Lucrehulk.
No, it's creepy cursed shadow moon.
No, it's interesting. Prospectors would haul what they found on the summit down this elevator.
No, it's just that little guy, there's somethin' about him, grinds my gears.
No, it's nothin'. Never mind.
No, just gotta stay on our toes.
No, just passing through. You're hunting for sounds?
No, lad. I'll show ye...
No, let me go!
No, let's hear it.
No, me neither.
No, my thrusters!
No, never! She's one of a kind.
No, no!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no!
No, no! Deal is off! Too risky!
No, no, I'm done with gambling. Done with it. Forever. Mostly.
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no! I mean recalibrate your axial piston, loosen your restraining bolt. You know, fun!
No, no, no, no, no...
No, no, please, I'm sorry!
No, no, they took leave of me spot - p'raps they were frightened by me crude gestures, eh? Haha!
No, no, they're not tears, what are you kidding me? No, it's probably smoke or something.
No, no.
No, no. That's okay.
No, no. Try again.
No, no...not yet...
No, not at all.
No, not bad.
No, not like this!
No, not like this!
No, not long.
No, not my jetpack.
No, not them! We were talking about how things ain't like the good ol' days.
No, not yet!
No, not you. You're a Separatist relic. Not the same.
No, nothin' yet.
No, of course not.
No, she does not.
No, she doesn't.
No, she doesn't.
No, she doesn't.
No, she hasn't.
No, she's gone.
No, silly. The second floor! Fresh and newly open for business.
No, sir!
No, sir. You're right, sir. I will man my post.
No, stop!
No, stop!
No, stop, I'm begging!
No, thank you, brother.
No, thank you.
No, thanks! I don't want those weirdos rooting through my ship!
No, the patrons! Who knows what kind of mischief Turgle is up to?
No, then listen up.
No, they don't.
No, they haven't reported in. There's no sign of them.
No, they were all killed in the Clone Wars...
No, they were not.
No, they will die at our hands.
No, we are not.
No, we had a whole crew, watched each other's backs.
No, you cannot!
No, you didn't think. You perceived a threat and reacted.
No, you told me you were handling it.
No, you won't kill me!
No, you won't.
No, you won't.
No, you would simply be destroyed.
No, you'd scare our quarry away, BD.
No, you're not.
No, you're positively inscrutable. I just happen to be an expert. Now, what's on your mind?
No-!
No--!
No-one escapes the Brood!
No-one knows. None of them clean their clothes!
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.

No. 
No. But I figured he'd pay me first, and I'd find one along the way.
No. But I know a fighter when I see one. And the valley could use more of your like.
No. But we will need a spamel to get there.
No. But we will need a spamel to get there.
No. But you may have, Cal.
No. Dispatch the target with lethal force.
No. Even false beliefs burn fierce in a fool's heart.
No. Falling into a sinkhole!
No. Folks tended to talk in pretty low voices about 'em, and not for very long.
No. Found it myself. Took it down.
No. Heard there's some emergency on Level 2034.
No. I am model 388.
No. I have to!
No. I like her.
No. I will protect what remains.
No. I would not travel lightly to the stronghold of our enemy.
No. It is safer that way.
No. It's been a while. You?
No. Most of us understand the danger the Empire poses to the galaxy, not just to our way of life.
No. My model number is earlier, meaning I am superior.
No. Never.
No. No yet. 
No. No, me neither, not really. Just found it interestin', is all.
No. Nobody has.
No. None. Understand?
No. Not exactly.
No. Santari must have purged the droid's memory bank. It has no knowledge of the compass.
No. To the Holy City. I'm going to sell them.
No. Wait. Stop. 
No. We eliminate them.
No. We're stronger together. Don't get ahead of yourself.
No. You cannot die.
No. You?
No. Your chassis is extraordinarily brittle.
No...
No...
No... I've changed a lot, now that you mention it.
No...I cannot entrust the little ones to the Raiders.
No? Did you?
No? Then stay out of my way. The key to victory is conviction.
Noble Jedi Knight, if you stay your hand I shall withdraw in peace.
Noble Jedi, there is something I feel you should see.
Noble Jedi, there is something I feel you should see.
Noble sage, I have another site worthy of your investigation, should you be interested.
Noble sage, I understand you have explored desert rumors at Master Cordova's request.
Noble sage, I understand you have explored desert rumors at Master Cordova's request.
Noble sage, I understand you have explored desert rumors at Master Cordova's request.
Noble, but perhaps foolish. Yet the Empire will applaud your dedication.
Nobody asked you!
Nobody asked your opinion, Cal Kestis.
Nobody can get past me; no droid, no beast, and definitely no Jedi.
Nobody does.
Nobody ever confirmed it, so probably not.
Nobody ever learned by finding what they were looking for - only by choosing to look for the right things.
Nobody has tamed one of these - you can see why!
Nobody is getting past me. Not without a blaster hole in 'em.
Nobody is supposed to be here, what's your business?
Nobody said our enemies would be Jedi!
Nobody that still lives.
Nobody told me we'd be fighting Jedi here!
Nobody told me we'd be fighting Jedi today.
Nobody touches my locomotion drive. I've been very clear about that.
Nobody will remember you. Nobody.
Nobody's perfect. You're fighting to give her a better life.
Noise over there. 
Noise over there. 
Noise, over there.
Noisy little thing.
Noki tosu! Bah!
None as talented as you, Santari.
None may stand against the Empire!
None of that creepy stuff, okay?
None of that seems very important now.
None of you are worthy of the Emperor's trust. I don't trust you.
None of your concern.
None will escape.
Nonsense!
Nonsense, Cal. Go fashion a story of your own. Mine can wait.
Nonsense. A few turns with a hydrospanner and you'll be as good as new.
Nonsense. He would never.
Noooo!
Nooooo!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Nope, let's keep looking!
Nope, still need it.
Nope, too close.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope. A rancor, caught in the majestic Koboh sun!
Nope. Maybe it moved itself.
Nope. Someone else will take care of it. 
Nor can I. But things are not so simple now, are they?
Normal, Priorite stealing eyes!
Normally I can shake these things, but...I keep thinking about Coruscant.
North?
Not Now
Not Now
Not Now
Not Now
Not Too Shabby
Not a bad change of scenery.
Not a bad find.
Not a bad find.
Not a bad idea. Where'd you learn to do that?
Not a bad selection.
Not a bad sound. Sampling this for sure.
Not a bad view from up here, huh?
Not a bad view, huh, buddy?
Not a chance!
Not a chance, Kestis!
Not a chance.
Not a chance.
Not a chance.
Not a chance. Can't risk it going straight to his oblong head.
Not a chance. I took this off my first target. It has sentimental value.
Not a chance. I wouldn't have survived the purge if I couldn't become someone else.
Not a clue.
Not a fan of Jawas?
Not a good day for these droids.
Not a lot of better places in this galaxy for the dispossessed than a cantina.
Not a lot of laughter in my life these days, Tulakt.
Not a moment's rest since Rayvis woke him up.
Not a pleasant smell.
Not a problem, not a problem!
Not a problem.
Not a scrap.
Not a single ranged attacker left.
Not a terrible view, huh?
Not according to the propaganda.
Not after ten thousand cycles.
Not again!
Not always. For big game, I usually bring a partner or two.
Not an easy target.
Not another B1 down!
Not another step, scum!
Not another step.
Not as easy as it looks, Cal!
Not as good as I would do it.
Not as good as I would do it.
Not as long as you, what's your point? Trying to make a big deal out it!?
Not at all.
Not at all. It's familiar, and kept me safe so far.
Not bad at all, right, BD?
Not bad for an abandoned facility.
Not bad yourself. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad!
Not bad, Bode.
Not bad, Cal.
Not bad, Jedi.
Not bad, Jedi.
Not bad, Jedi.
Not bad, huh buddy? Conditions are perfect for a garden.
Not bad, think we can walk on that?
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad. 
Not bad. 
Not bad. He opened up a cantina, Pyloon's Saloon.
Not bad. I didn't think you could hack it.
Not bad. I told her I was bringing her a gift.
Not bad. I've seen worse rooftop gardens.
Not bad. Maybe you can keep up with me now.
Not blasting me.
Not budging.
Not budging.
Not changing a thing.
Not coming in, Greez?
Not completely, Zee. I'm a Jedi, alright.
Not crazy about this assignment. Too many unknowns.
Not done with you yet. 
Not done yet.
Not done yet.
Not done yet? Fine.
Not enough to down me. 
Not enough.
Not even Rayvis?
Not even close!
Not even close!
Not even close.
Not even gonna try to guess what that means.
Not even good for scrap, in the end. Disappointing.
Not even that Jedi scum.
Not even that stopped a lightsaber?
Not everyday you see someone who fought a gorocco and lived to tell the tale!
Not everyone has the strength to make the journey.
Not everyone's up to that standard.
Not everyone. Pi'tar left because he got a job off-world.
Not everything.
Not everything.
Not exactly a fair exchange.
Not exactly my intention.
Not exactly. Also, not a nap.
Not exactly. I quit. With little notice. I found the job distasteful to say the least.
Not exactly. In the watering hole, I found a shiny rock that the stormtrooper is sure to buy!
Not exactly. Though prospectors do ask me to read the planet's fortune from time to time.
Not exactly. We had our spats here and there. A bad egg or two. One time we had a whole mess of a family feud.
Not expecting any more changes here.
Not faaaair!
Not faaaiiir!
Not fair!
Not falling for it.
Not far now.
Not fast enough for a lightsaber.
Not fast enough!
Not fast enough.
Not fast enough. 
Not feeling so great, BD.
Not for him.
Not for long.
Not for long. We shall destroy him.
Not from you I don't.
Not getting away.
Not getting away. 
Not getting back up that way.
Not getting through.
Not getting up from that.
Not givin' up. 
Not going to get away.
Not gone, Kata. When we die, we return to help new plants grow.
Not gonna be easy.
Not gonna stop me!
Not gonna stop me.
Not good - no more probe's.
Not good enough!
Not good enough!
Not good enough!
Not good enough.
Not good enough.
Not good enough.
Not good for the B2
Not good not good not good.
Not good!
Not good!
Not good.
Not great, old man.
Not half an hour later, they walk out of the Reach, lookin' like they found a ghost in their navicomputer.
Not happening!
Not happening.
Not happening.
Not happening.
Not happening.
Not haunted.
Not here, not now.
Not holding. We'll need to reinforce the chamber again.
Not hope. This is known. The only question is when.
Not how I wanted that to go.
Not if we don't get out there soon!
Not if you give your position away like that.
Not impressed.
Not impressed.
Not impressive.
Not in a thousand Latero sunsets. No, not in two thousand!
Not in the way you assume. I observe the world around me, and the voice within my mind speaks.
Not inspiring. The Empire-Stoppers?
Not interested.
Not its arm! It needs that.
Not just because its claws are sharper than the bristles on ma lip...
Not just fer ma own justice - but tae liberate ma very home.
Not just read about it on a caf-stained terminal, you know?
Not like anyone here has credits to spend...
Not like there's an Empire what's invading the planet.
Not like this!
Not like this!
Not like this!
Not like us.
Not likely.
Not likely.
Not likely.
Not likely. 
Not liking that combo.
Not liking this.
Not long after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire cracked down on my shipping operation. They ruined everything.
Not long now, Jedi.
Not long now, Jedi. 
Not long now.
Not long. A few jobs here and there.
Not long. We worked together on Coruscant.
Not looking forward to it.
Not loving that idea, honestly.
Not loving this guy.
Not me!
Not me, friend!
Not missing with this.
Not much going on outside.
Not much left of it now.
Not much left of that B1.
Not much left of those droids!
Not much longer.
Not much of a commando droid without that!
Not much of a fight.
Not much of a gorger left..
Not much to look at...
Not much, I'm afraid. It could be a key, a weapon, a small component of a larger device...
Not much. A lot of fauna - some dangerous - but scattered across a wide area.
Not much. It would be unwise to keep any presence there now.
Not my day to die.
Not my first Jedi bounty.
Not my goal. So the Brood can't let go of the past, huh?
Not my jetpack!
Not my preferred weather forecast. But more common by the day.
Not my thing.
Not neccessary. 
Not necessary. We're gonna win.
Not now that we have this.
Not now!
Not now!
Not now! 
Not now, Cal.
Not now, Cal. I have too much to plan. So many people to contact. So many schemes to scheme...
Not now, Cal. I'm pretty sure Monk reorganized my entire spice rack, but I don't know exactly what he changed.
Not now, Cal. Why don't we catch up once you've returned from the Forest Array?
Not now, I need some time to think.
Not now, but I appreciate it, Monk.
Not now, dear.
Not now, kid. Shake a leg.
Not now, okay?
Not now.
Not now.
Not now.
Not now.
Not now.
Not now. 
Not now. Barkeep!
Not now. We need to stay sharp.
Not now...
Not now...
Not one for conversation, are you?
Not one of my strong suits.
Not one of our targets. What was the payout?
Not our fault!
Not our most skilled stormtrooper. 
Not out of it yet!
Not planning on it.
Not possible!
Not possible.
Not possible...
Not possible...
Not quick enough!
Not quick enough.
Not quick enough. 
Not quite to extinction.
Not quite!
Not quite!
Not quite.
Not ready for this.
Not ready yet!
Not ready yet!
Not ready yet.
Not really a fair fight.
Not really.
Not really.
Not really.
Not really. But if you don't open up to anyone, how can you make any friends?
Not really. I think he misses traveling with all of us more than anyone.
Not right now, Cal. I need some time to think.
Not since you put Rayvis on the run. Come to think of it, they've been veeeeery quiet since then.
Not so bad.
Not so big now!
Not so close!
Not so close!
Not so close!
Not so close.
Not so close.
Not so close. 
Not so confident now!
Not so deadly!
Not so easy, are we?
Not so easy, huh?
Not so fast!
Not so fast!
Not so fast!
Not so fast!
Not so fast, Senator.
Not so fast.
Not so fast.
Not so fast.
Not so fast.
Not so fast. 
Not so fast. 
Not so great, are ya!
Not so great.
Not so scary now.
Not so tough now, is it?
Not so tough!
Not something I expected to hear from a historian.
Not staying in one place too long. 
Not stuck, are you?
Not such a hard shell after all.
Not such a warm welcome.
Not sure Greez would like his ship compared to a bantha.
Not sure I do.
Not sure I'm followin'.
Not sure if I saw movement. 
Not sure what I just heard. 
Not sure what I'm seeing. 
Not sure what that means but you all look safe.
Not sure what that was...
Not sure what you mean.
Not sure what you're sayin'.
Not sure why I even mentioned it...
Not sure wildlife preservation is on the Empire's list of priorities.
Not sure yet. Cordova's going to inspect the tech we brought him.
Not sure, exactly. Just feeling restless. Time to move on.
Not sure, they were from the High Republic. Hundreds of years old.
Not sure. Haven't heard from him since Coruscant.
Not sure. We lost some people close to us.
Not sure. We lost some people close to us.
Not surprised. Sorc's crew was always into cybernetics, you're nothing but an overly devoted fan.
Not that I have come across.
Not that I'd trust Greez to make drinks. He's a fine cook, but he's got no taste for tonics.
Not that I'm, uh, too picky. You meet any more lost souls with sob stories, send 'em over to Pyloon's, ya hear?
Not that I've seen.
Not that it matters! You're done for, I'm afraid.
Not that many.
Not that there's a spaceport this side of the Rishi Maze that won't turn us in.
Not that they ever get it...
Not that we're business partners, of course; you don't have the credentials to...
Not the B2 unit!
Not the breakthrough we were hoping for.
Not the hardest bounty I've taken down. 
Not the response I'd expected.
Not the usual cheery greeting I've grown accustomed to, but I won't pry into your personal life.
Not the valet service I was hoping for.
Not the welcome I was hoping for.
Not the word I'd use.
Not there!
Not this again.
Not this one. I come along, or we walk.
Not this time!
Not this time!
Not this time.
Not this time.
Not this time.
Not this time.
Not this time. 
Not this time. 
Not this!
Not to mention a Nightsister of Dathomir, Greez.
Not to worry, I will remain here and look after Greez and the others.
Not to worry, boss. After all, I was programmed to follow rules.
Not to worry. I will stay here and look after Greez and the others.
Not to worry. I'm planning on springing for a new recirculator.
Not today Jedi!
Not today!
Not today!
Not today!
Not today, Jedi!
Not today, Jedi. 
Not today, Jedi. 
Not today, friend.
Not today.
Not today.
Not today.
Not today. 
Not today. I'm exhausted.
Not too far. Just pass the canyon ridge then into the valley.
Not too good with the Empire all over, but no sense in gettin' worked up over something you can't control.
Not too late to put this behind us, Caij.
Not too late to run.
Not too sturdy.
Not two months after she gets here but her general store pops into bein'.
Not unless you want to dodge some blaster fire.
Not until the Jedi Council gave the order to abandon Tanalorr and then refused to counterattack.
Not up for a fight?
Not very well. Did you?
Not what I expected you to say. Any idea why they're there?
Not what I expected.
Not what you were expecting?
Not when I met him. He was running a perfectly legitimate port on Rodia.
Not when I'm around!
Not where I thought this was going. How did that save you?
Not with my blaster.
Not with our new friend. And now we have time to catch up.
Not with that attitude you won't. 
Not with this guy guarding the door, heh.
Not without some help.
Not worth my time.
Not worth our time.
Not yet!
Not yet! Most of our patrons like to stick with the old standards.
Not yet, Kestis!
Not yet, but I will.
Not yet, but I've been preparing for this a long time. I'm ready.
Not yet, but we found some devices from the High Republic. Master Cordova's inspecting them now.
Not yet, still trying to find a way inside.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Not yet. I was on prisoner duty this morning and haven't had a chance.
Not yet. The shuttle is on unstable terrain. We've lost enough troopers as it is.
Not yet. Wait, don't tell me you're thinking of sampling them?
Not yet. We have a mission to accomplish.
Not your day!
Not your scene?
Not your typical blaster.
Not... yet!
Noted.
Noted.
Noted.
Noted.
Noted: droideka down.
Nothin' I ain't seen before!
Nothin' but a coward.
Nothin' left but the crunchy bits.
Nothin' personal, you understand?
Nothin' personal. But you start handing out  freebies, you have people up in arms asking 'why not me, Doma?'
Nothing
Nothing I wouldn't do myself.
Nothing I'm going to tell you.
Nothing about mercy in the Code.
Nothing but air...
Nothing but ash!
Nothing but dust awaits you!
Nothing can stop us! Even a lightsaber is no match for my blaster.
Nothing can stop us, Cal.
Nothing compared to the horror I will inflict upon them.
Nothing does.
Nothing for me. But I've got a daughter now. And if you can keep her safe, the question is - what can I do for you?
Nothing good can come of working with them.
Nothing has changed.
Nothing is going to hurt me.
Nothing is happening.
Nothing is making it work.
Nothing lasts forever, big wheel. That goes for the good and the bad.
Nothing left but scrap!
Nothing left of that droideka.
Nothing left of the BX droids.
Nothing makes you feel alive like the thrill of death.
Nothing old Greezy needs to solve for ya?
Nothing personal.
Nothing stops that lightsaber!
Nothing to See
Nothing to report.
Nothing today, maybe tomorrow!
Nothing we couldn't handle.
Nothing will escape my detection.
Nothing will stand in my way!
Nothing wrong with quiet. Maybe just relax, Greez.
Nothing yet.
Nothing yet.
Nothing!
Nothing's a match for a lightsaber!
Nothing's more important to Greez than family.
Nothing's worth crossing the Raiders, now move!
Nothing, just taking a break.
Nothing, thanks.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing. Guess I'll enjoy the weather.
Nothing. Just thinking.
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing...
Notice anythin' different?
Noticed something.
Notification: Pursuing intruder. 
Nova Garon System.
Now - get him!
Now Bode intends to use it as a hideout while the Path has no home.
Now Bode uses it as a hideout while the refugees are out in the cold.
Now I can get back to work...
Now I can't fly.
Now I don't wanna clip this mynock's wings, but I certainly have my doubts about that.
Now I have the high ground.
Now I know it's not good.
Now I know you're a Jedi.
Now I know you're just trying to wind me up. That's not very nice, you know!
Now I see why the Jedi were wiped out.
Now I'm cookin'.
Now I'm mad!
Now I'm taking orders from a droid?
Now I'm wondering why Dagan sent Rayvis instead of going himself.
Now I've got ya.
Now all I see are those atrocious, though admittedly effective, stormtrooper helmets.
Now attack him!
Now attack!
Now attack!
Now counter!
Now die!
Now drop me!
Now every time I sit on that broken cushion, it feels like Lizz is still there.
Now fer a story, if ye've the time.
Now fer a tale, lad?
Now for the fun part.
Now get out of here. I don't have time for you.
Now go. Lock it down!
Now he comes to us.
Now he leads a band of raiders on the Outer Rim.
Now he understands.
Now he's coming for me!
Now here's the question: do you have what it takes to best the rest of these tacticians?
Now hold on, that's different. We knew that planet was full of nasties, but this moon...
Now hold on, that's different. We knew that planet was full of nasties, but this moon...
Now how's it meant to shoot!?
Now if I just...
Now if only I could get this ringing in my ears to stop! Huh? What'd you say?
Now if you'll excuse me,
Now is not the time to speak.
Now is not the time!
Now it ain't easy for me to admit, but...
Now it ends!
Now it's a fight!
Now it's a fight!
Now it's a fight!
Now it's a fight.
Now it's a ghost town.
Now it's real.
Now it's real.
Now it's too late to clean the Mantis. I hope she doesn't notice.
Now keep an eye out, a Jedi has been spotted in the area.
Now keep your voice down. I've got some ideas...
Now kill him!
Now let's see what's in your head, droid. Santari must've left something useful.
Now look at it.
Now look at that.
Now maybe it's time for you to be something more than a lightsaber.
Now or never!
Now or never!
Now or never.
Now she's crossed the line.
Now she's gone. Rayvis is gone.
Now tell me the truth, I can take it!
Now that Merrin's with us, we can go back to Coruscant.
Now that he is gone, I find myself remembering the man he was.
Now that is a big one.
Now that is new...
Now that is quite impressive.
Now that looks like a stage!
Now that seems a contradiction in terms. What's it gonna be?
Now that would make this fight even greater!
Now that you've proven yourself a proper hunter, you might as well play the part!
Now that you've taken down every hired gun that Sorc Tormo sent after you.
Now that's a Doma Dendra guarantee.
Now that's a compliment.
Now that's a dilemma...
Now that's a holokill!
Now that's an Imperial base.
Now that's enough!
Now that's just not nice!
Now that's not somethin' to sniff at.
Now that's not very fair.
Now that's the best news I've heard all day. I'll take that challenge. I'll make them pay.
Now that's unexpected.
Now the endgame.
Now the fun begins!
Now there's an unusual sight.
Now there's bits of shell everywhere.
Now there's someone with a deathwish.
Now there's somethin' you don't see often.
Now they all just reek of desperation, and fear.
Now this is gripping.
Now this is more my speed!
Now this is no fair. 
Now this is no fair. 
Now this is worth my time.
Now this'll be a fight!
Now to deal with the droid...
Now to execute your friends!
Now to finally get the accolades I deserve.
Now to kill you and take it for myself!
Now to test my work. Droid, kill them.
Now we finish them.
Now we have him cornered, with nowhere else to run.
Now we have the strength to reach the crossing.
Now we just need to rescue Zee.
Now we know what killed those prospectors...
Now we wait.
Now we will see how tough you are.
Now we will see how tuff you are.
Now we're in business. Mine is just down yonder, you can't miss it.
Now we're out of B1s to use!
Now we're talking!
Now we're talking.
Now we're talking...
Now what did I do?
Now what do we do?
Now what do we do?
Now what do we do?
Now what was that?
Now what's this?
Now what, Jedi?
Now where are ya?
Now where did he go. 
Now where did you go?
Now where should this go...
Now where to start.
Now where'd he go?
Now where'd he go?
Now where'd he go?
Now where'd you get that?
Now where'd you go?
Now where'd you go?
Now who is blinded by the past?
Now why'd you do that?
Now you go ahead and look. I keep a lot of spare parts down there.
Now you pay.
Now you see me!
Now you sound like a Jedi.
Now you understand the might of the Empire.
Now you will feed the other creatures.
Now you will suffer.
Now you'll bleed!
Now you'll both die painfully!
Now you'll pay.
Now you'll pay.
Now you'll really grow!
Now you'll see.
Now you're finished!
Now you're getting it bud!
Now you're gonna hurt!
Now you're gonna hurt!
Now you're just yanking my Waluna ears.
Now you're letting him win.
Now you're starting to get it. Drink up - while you still can.
Now you're worth my time.
Now you've angered me.
Now you've completely lost me, Cal. 
Now you've done it.
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!

Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now! Close in!
Now! Shoot him now!
Now! While he's distracted!
Now's not the time.
Now's your chance!
Now, BD!
Now, BD!
Now, Bode!
Now, Cal! Jump!
Now, Cere!
Now, I know you've got a lot on your plate, but one of my patrons set off to the swamp.
Now, I'm serious.
Now, I'm serious.
Now, Merrin!
Now, Merrin!
Now, Nightsister!
Now, all I have are my plants. They are defiant, in their own way.
Now, buddy!
Now, die!
Now, end this!
Now, face me!
Now, face me!
Now, in the central desert, one more site remains.
Now, it gets interesting.
Now, it's not in my nature to stick my nose in other people's business, but are you leaving too?
Now, it's too risky to venture outside, and we send communications only when absolutely necessary.
Now, let's show you how to use it.
Now, now, now - no need to get your fur spiked! So how long have you two known each other?
Now, shall we continue my tale?
Now, suffer.
Now, that's what I like to hear, killer.
Now, the mystery...what the bloody hell did she say to 'em?! I'd kill to know!
Now, the rest of them.
Now, we finish this!
Now, we're talking!
Now, what brings you all to Jedha?
Now, what secrets do you hold...?
Now, what was that?
Now, where else to plant this...
Now, which tool of negotiation should I start with first?
Now, you're startin' to sound like a real pro, Cal.
Now.
Now.
Now. Let's finish this. 
Now. Where should we go next?
Now...where's that Nightsister?
Nowadays we call your era the 'High Republic'.
Nowhere left to run!
Nowhere to hide now.
Nowhere to hide.
Nowhere to run now.
Nudd chaa, pateesa!
Nudd chaa.
Nuh, uh, uh.

Numbers falling.
Numbers reduced.
Nyeaah!

O' course, when I returned home, things were not as I remembered them...
Objective complete.
Objective complete.
Obliterate him!
Obliterate them.
Obliterated!
Obliterating.
Observatory Array, aligned.
Observatory is up ahead.
Observe that death and adjust.
Observe the roots that rise up underneath, helping the flowers to reach nearby light sources.
Observe, little ones. We have a visitor.
Observe. 
Observing a threat.
Observing.
Obtained.
Obvious.
Obviously not. You passed the test, metal man.
Och! Rayvis is neither fish nor fowl. Can't ye see I'm occupied with my fish?
Och, an' that dreadful stench was abrew in his rotten beard. An augur of fate most ill.
Och, but the noble was nae so lucky.
Och, lad, I've a powerful itch on ma back.
Och, she was just here! It's settin' me a-tremble...
Octane and firecracker bitters. That's enough to send a Hutt to the hospital.
Odds are in our favor now.
Odds of victory greatly improved.
Odds of victory have dropped... substantially. 
Odds of victory increased.
Of all the dust bowls in all the galaxy, a Jedi had to wander into mine.
Of all the luck, a Jedi on our turf. Thought I'd manage to get away never havin' to greet one.
Of all the luck. I really did not want to be at this post.
Of course I am. Nobody knew the market like him.
Of course I did! Who doesn't take patrol notes?
Of course my respirator would get clogged.
Of course not. How could you? From what Cordova told us, Dagan could be trouble.
Of course that doesn't mean we get a crowd or anything, but it's still a rush for me!
Of course!
Of course! Don't you ever listen?
Of course! How silly of me. But if you go back, be on the look out for that ablative coating!
Of course! I could not pass up a find like Zee.
Of course! This is my first time beyond the Mid Rim, but I can already tell this place is a trove.
Of course! Wait, is there something wrong with my blaster?
Of course, 'luck' is a simplification. This device was created by Jedi, after all.
Of course, Cal. If you feel like doing some weeding, we could use that too.
Of course, Greez.
Of course, Greez.
Of course, I meant no disrespect! How delightful.
Of course, I would not believe in that kind of thing.
Of course, Kata.
Of course, Zee.
Of course, back in Khri's day, there was no Empire to contend with.
Of course, he slices a B1.
Of course, if you think it's best.
Of course, my adventure had only begun. For just when the Grapnel hit orbit...
Of course, yes!
Of course, you'd have to overhaul the plumbing, hire some real security, attend to those outrageous drink prices -
Of course, you're not getting rid of me that easily.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Of course. 
Of course. Better to walk into the trap you know than the one you don't see.
Of course. But this is not the first life lost in our struggle, and it will not be the last.
Of course. But we have changed, not the place.
Of course. I will depart shortly.
Of course. I'll be here.
Of course. I'm just saying...
Of course. Unlike my speeder.
Of course. Wait, destroyed!?
Of course...you know, the darnedest thing, we couldn't get your Lateron Stew to taste right at all.
Off I go. 
Off to the Emperor with you. 
Off we go!
Off we go.
Off-balance.
Offensive strike on living being.
Offer refused. My schematics were designed to specification.
Official probe underway.
Oh , too quick for you. 
Oh , you're in trouble, Jedi. 
Oh -- for Pete's sake -- you ain't goin on about them... "millenials" again, are ya?
Oh Cal, I am so very sorry.
Oh Cal, I'm so happy here. I can't thank you enough for inviting me to the cantina.
Oh Cal, here you are. So, is that how it happened?
Oh Harr, the ol' gossip hound with boring, tired stories.
Oh I ain't goin' nowhere. I ain't riskin' my neck.
Oh I don't like that he can do that.
Oh I don't think so!
Oh I know what it means.
Oh I stand ready for your order. It would be my honor to see Master Khri's dream alive once more.
Oh I'll keep looking!
Oh I'll never be able to fix that!
Oh I'll show you.
Oh I'm always on the lookout.
Oh Kestis!
Oh Kestis, you never learn, do you.
Oh Pili, that weirdo.
Oh Zee, that is so brave of you. How'd you escape?
Oh absolutely not.
Oh alright, hi, nice to meet you. Unfortunately I don't think I have another bed available.
Oh amazing!
Oh boy am I happy to see the two of you!
Oh boy, I'm done for.
Oh boy, let's go.
Oh boy, lets go.
Oh boy, this guy knows his audience.
Oh boy, you know what, I don't remember.
Oh brother, not this again.
Oh come now!
Oh come now!
Oh come on, it's the least I could do after everything we've been through.
Oh come on.
Oh come on.
Oh come on. 
Oh come on. 
Oh dear.
Oh don't look so nervous.
Oh everything burns, even Jedi.
Oh finally, I was worried sick - wait.
Oh garlic, that's it! We ran out of garlic. Better remind Monk to find some next time we're at Pyloon's.
Oh good. Well, you deserve it. Now if only I could get rid of this ringing in my ears!
Oh great, our Probe is down.
Oh great.
Oh great. He's got stims.
Oh great. Our droid's down.
Oh great. Stims.
Oh ha ha, very funny.
Oh he's a feisty Jedi.
Oh he's fast.
Oh he's hurting now!
Oh he's hurting!
Oh he's injured!
Oh he's really good!
Oh he's shaking!
Oh hey!
Oh ho!
Oh it was bad, real bad!
Oh it was. Oh it was. Back then. But now, funny, it all seems like a great story that I wish I could live again.
Oh it's time for some holotactics!
Oh look at that!
Oh look, he's scared!
Oh me oh my! No one can beat Cal Kestis. No one!
Oh my pleasure.
Oh my!
Oh my!
Oh my, I have something Cal wants.
Oh my, what is that?
Oh my. Do you see that?
Oh my. Oh my, is there something wrong with my circuitry?
Oh no I'm not. This is the normal color of my face. A very normal, typical color.
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no! And I just got promoted...
Oh no! He got away. 
Oh no! He was our last flametrooper!
Oh no! He's got stims!
Oh no! It's gone!
Oh no! No!
Oh no! Something's wrong!
Oh no! That's our last gunner...
Oh no, Mosey's leaving.
Oh no, he's gone again!
Oh no, my high score!
Oh no, not our B1s!
Oh no, of course not, Mosey.
Oh no, that was our last ranged trooper!
Oh no, that's not good.
Oh no, what are we going to do?
Oh no-!
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Oh no. He's hurt. 
Oh no. I'm next. 
Oh no. It's just me.
Oh no. Now he looks mad. 
Oh no. Oh no no no.
Oh no. Oh no!
Oh no. Our Viper droids are down.
Oh no. Our droid is down.
Oh no. Our probes are down.
Oh no. That was our last gunner.
Oh no. That's our last flametrooper.
Oh no. That's our last rocket trooper.
Oh no. Was that our last melee unit? 
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh now he's recovering...
Oh now he's running.
Oh now that is impressive.
Oh now that saber I like.
Oh okay, okay. Good luck with that, don't die, and give the space witch my regards.
Oh please no.
Oh please, I'd drink those worms under the table. Which, by the way, I have.
Oh right...good point. How about you help me cook some meals?
Oh sure, sure. Yeah, I'll definitely do that.
Oh sure. Sounds like a few people might bow out, and I can't blame 'em, but I've got art to make.
Oh sweetie, I could use an oil bath now that you mention it.
Oh thank goodness! Thought I was gonna have to book it for a second there.
Oh that Cal Kestis.
Oh that looks bad...
Oh that went down fast!
Oh that's a big beast!
Oh that's good!
Oh that's impossible, the Abyss eats any ship that gets too close!
Oh that's not good at all.
Oh that's not good at all.
Oh that's not good!
Oh that's so much work for me now.
Oh that's unpleasant.
Oh there are ways around that.
Oh they are relentless!
Oh they don't look so happy!
Oh they're gonna feel that.
Oh they're out there. Keep looking.
Oh they're out!
Oh this fight'll be fun!
Oh this is fun. 
Oh this is just my luck!
Oh this is not good. We gotta get out of here!
Oh this isn't good...
Oh this one's not joking around.
Oh this will be fun.
Oh this will be quick. 
Oh we got a tough guy here. 
Oh we're chasing now?
Oh well that's a mistake.
Oh what a fine model.
Oh who cares?
Oh wow, that is hot.
Oh wow.
Oh yeah of course. Patrols disappear all the time. Without a trace.
Oh yeah sure. [nervous chuckle] As long as I don't have anything they need.
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, I shoulda guessed. They've been creepin' around Koboh too lately.
Oh yeah, a few times!
Oh yeah, got a jetpack.
Oh yeah, he's scared. 
Oh yeah, if you promised you can bring them home alive.
Oh yeah, me too.
Oh yeah, see you there?
Oh yeah, sure kid. Sure, I mean, someday. But let's wait until you're older.
Oh yeah, there were some old droids. They looked like they could use a new home.
Oh yeah, we almost died, like, ten times. But once we layered those samples over some lofi Trandoshan funk -
Oh yeah, whadaya got another holocron?
Oh yeah, you go ahead and try. But seriously, you've done good by us. Watching out for the kid.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah. Absolutely filthy soundscape - real solid samples. Things got really going when I met Deedee, though.
Oh yeah. I was out in the Ryloth system one time.
Oh yeah. In more ways than you can know. But don't you dare tell him that.
Oh yeah. Took real talent to drop that durasteel brace on me.
Oh yeah. You're a natural hunter and you damn well know it.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah? BD couldn't fill my shoes, huh?
Oh yeah? Hey!
Oh yeah? I'm great with kids.
Oh yeah? Like you helped Cal on Coruscant?
Oh yeah? We'll see!
Oh yeah? Well, let's hope there aren't any consequences for the rest of us.
Oh yeah? What'd she do?
Oh yeah? Why should we?
Oh yeah? You think so, huh? Well, I was right about the Witch planet!
Oh yeah? You'll make a great addition to my raider collection!
Oh yes, and I don't know how much longer those vines will be able to hold you.
Oh yes.
Oh yes. I've been waiting for this.
Oh you have no idea!
Oh you have something about you, something different.
Oh you know, Kata, I'd like to, but someone has to stay and look after the place.
Oh you know, just hanging out.
Oh you like your chances, huh?
Oh you want to play?
Oh you would have loved her! You remember that zoochberry pie I made you?
Oh you'll feel this!
Oh you're a big one!
Oh you're asking questions far beyond my ability to answer.
Oh you're dangerous!
Oh you're dead. 
Oh you're done for now!
Oh you're done for.
Oh you're going down.
Oh you're mine.
Oh you're not done yet, huh?
Oh you're on a hyperlane to nowhere, aren't you?
Oh you're so dead!
Oh you're so done for.
Oh you're too kind, BD.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh! A newcomer. Who are you?
Oh! A vicious bilemaw charge attack!
Oh! Careful now.
Oh! He bleeds!
Oh! He felt that!
Oh! He's bleedin'!
Oh! He's bleedin'!
Oh! He's gone again. 
Oh! He's hurting!
Oh! He's quick!
Oh! Hello, who's there!?
Oh! Hold on. 
Oh! Honestly, I was unsure if I would ever see you again.
Oh! I can smell the credits!
Oh! Nice dodge!
Oh! No!
Oh! Not the B1s!
Oh! Oh, it's you.
Oh! The starboard manifolds!
Oh! Up there!
Oh! What's that?
Oh! Where did you come from? 
Oh! You hear that crunch?
Oh! You incinerated him, didn't you?!
Oh! You're too quick!
Oh! [frantic noises]
Oh, BX will remember that.
Oh, Cal! Gimme a second, would ya?
Oh, Cal! I can't tell you enough how grateful I am you saved me!
Oh, Cal! It's delightful to see you fully intact.
Oh, Cal, Cal, Cal. You're looking at a professional.
Oh, Cal, isn't it awful? I left Coruscant to get away from the Empire.
Oh, Cal, this is simply amazing!
Oh, Cal. I see you have already looked inside.
Oh, Cal. Whatever it is, I am deeply sorry. You tell me when you're ready, and not a moment sooner.
Oh, Cal...if I could only go back to that moment when I shook Captain Whett's ridged hand.
Oh, I cannae take it much longer.
Oh, I could surprise you. I love surprises.
Oh, I don't know about that. Depends on whether you cooperate.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. I think I'll slum it here a while longer.
Oh, I don't know. I was in low power mode, so I'm not sure if company would have made a difference.
Oh, I don't know. Not every reward is in credits. Besides, pretty sure I get free room and board here at Pyloon's.
Oh, I get it now! She's saying there's a big score to be had in some silty river.
Oh, I had my reasons.
Oh, I had to, kid.
Oh, I have been asleep for a very long time, haven't I, Cal?
Oh, I hope they're okay...
Oh, I hope this hurts.
Oh, I knew it! A true loyalist. Such a joy to meet a well-programmed pro.
Oh, I know how to use this. I'm top of my squad.
Oh, I know it.
Oh, I want that sword.
Oh, I will.
Oh, I'd bet credits he can.
Oh, I'd tell you if I did.
Oh, I'll be on their list of priorities soon enough.
Oh, I'll get through. 
Oh, I'll get ya.
Oh, I'll get you.
Oh, I'll scarce forget the snarl he issued as he turned tae me, slow as a frozen reef -
Oh, I'm attacking from all angles.
Oh, I'm in a mood, alright.
Oh, I'm in a mood, alright.
Oh, I'm not in the mood to drink.
Oh, I'm warning you, Turgle.
Oh, I've got just the thing for you!
Oh, Kata - so much more!
Oh, Kestis.
Oh, Master Khri. Why did you send me to free that traitor?
Oh, Okay.
Oh, Turgle...
Oh, a Jedi!
Oh, a cactus ball!
Oh, a chase! 
Oh, a wanderer in this solitude.
Oh, amazing. Every building is partially suspended with repulsors.
Oh, an air of confidence, perhaps?
Oh, an energy weapon!
Oh, and Bravo said no comms.
Oh, and I might need some of your blood.
Oh, and I've only just begun, lad. If ye've a moment, I'll continue me tale...
Oh, and Merrin's coming along.
Oh, and a small island!
Oh, and lad, I know what ye'll say:
Oh, and some advice, lad - if yer plannin' tae scale the mountain, ye'll need tae keep a strong grip.
Oh, and then crashing her into an Outer Rim rock, you did okay.
Oh, and uh, say hey to Doma Dendra when you get in town. She, uh, doesn't take kindly to strangers.
Oh, are you now? That's an...unexpected behavior. I like it, though.
Oh, at last!
Oh, aye. A vooplak is just what ye need.
Oh, bad choice. 
Oh, before I forget. I heard there were a pair of newcomers over by the stone spires, might want to look for 'em.
Oh, blast, sorry 'bout that. Came at you like a rawka, I did.
Oh, brutal. 
Oh, but I do have some good news.
Oh, but I have so much to tell you about - it'll take ages!
Oh, but she did! We still laugh about it!
Oh, can't wait.
Oh, clever.
Oh, come now! I can bear a little bad news. Spare no detail!
Oh, come now. If you're a lover, like myself, you don't just move on!
Oh, come on!
Oh, come on!
Oh, come on! 
Oh, come on! You cannot tell me you're completely disinterested.
Oh, dear.
Oh, deep cut. Aren't those only performed underwater?
Oh, did that sting?
Oh, do not despair, sojourner. The galaxy still turns, and dawn will break through your night.
Oh, don't spare my circuits! Tell me what you really think.
Oh, don't tell me you plan on rescuing her?
Oh, everything from cataloguing datadiscs to collating star maps. 
Oh, exciting!
Oh, exciting!
Oh, fer a black instant, I considered nailin' those pirate Quarren tae the rocks with ma harpoon.
Oh, fine, I'll tell ye! At yer own insistence...and at yer own peril.
Oh, for the love of...
Oh, fun!
Oh, get lost!
Oh, good!
Oh, good! Thank you sir, I won't let you down!
Oh, good.
Oh, good.
Oh, gotcha.
Oh, great!
Oh, great! It's just me then?
Oh, ha ha. Bartender and comedian. What did I do to deserve you?
Oh, he has a strength...
Oh, he really can fight.
Oh, he returns! Returns for the spoils, yes?
Oh, he's full of nonsense. Don't pay him any mind.
Oh, he's got stims. 
Oh, he's moving!
Oh, he's running!
Oh, he's wriggling!
Oh, hello there again, Cal.
Oh, hello!
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello...
Oh, here it comes.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, hey, I appreciate it.
Oh, hey, it's you! I saw you tearing through the woods!
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey?
Oh, hi!
Oh, hi.
Oh, how I have missed this!
Oh, how nice it must be to have such an empty cranium.
Oh, how precious.
Oh, how tragic.
Oh, if it isn't mister 'I hunted a mogu'.
Oh, if your Order could see you now.
Oh, it never stood a chance!
Oh, it seems upset...
Oh, it's Bode. I'd bet the saloon on it.
Oh, it's on!
Oh, it's quite simple. I wanted children, but the galaxy had other plans.
Oh, it's so small.
Oh, it's you!
Oh, lad, I almost...tore ma lungs...asunder! Ma eyes...th-they went dark...!
Oh, local legend holds that those ruins are chock full of ghosts.
Oh, look at you, so hopeful. Like a hope fountain or something.
Oh, look!
Oh, nice!
Oh, nicely done!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, I am going to kill him.
Oh, no, young Jedi. Your master found us.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. You don't 'get away' from the Hutts.
Oh, no...
Oh, not again. 
Oh, not bad.
Oh, not fun.
Oh, not good.
Oh, not that. Anything but that!
Oh, of course. And we're watching them.
Oh, oh! Sour berries, roast pomork. Oh I wonder if I could find some meatvine!
Oh, okay. I like pruning best.
Oh, okay. Yeah, uh, mine neither.
Oh, oops!
Oh, please.
Oh, plenty. We explored the ruins of a lost, ancient civilization on Zeffo.
Oh, quit complaining. I'm almost done. There! Good as new.
Oh, quit wobblin' yer jaw.
Oh, really?
Oh, really? More of you?
Oh, really? You like this dusty, empty cantina?
Oh, right in two!
Oh, right, yeah, of course.
Oh, right.
Oh, right. Er, sorry 'bout that.
Oh, right. Must be that ringing in my ears. The other day, this roller mine blew up, nearly took my head off!
Oh, right. Of course. Of...course...
Oh, right. Yeah.
Oh, she'd have loved to know that! Food was her whole thing - she taught me everything I know!
Oh, so what, you're a chef now?
Oh, sure, we all had plans to get ours and get lost. But what's the real reason we don't leave?
Oh, sure. A Separatist secession backed by tax-loathing free marketeers begins...
Oh, thank ye, lad.
Oh, that is Raider territory now, darling.
Oh, that seems bad for us.
Oh, that sure is large!
Oh, that thing's spikey!
Oh, that tittle-tattler is full of nonsense. Don't pay him any mind.
Oh, that's bad!
Oh, that's comforting.
Oh, that's it!
Oh, that's it!
Oh, that's mighty kind of you, but I've already got a line on a recirculator for half even.
Oh, the BX are gone.
Oh, the Clone Wars. Those were the good years.
Oh, the Force chose me for victory, you'll see!
Oh, the hunt.
Oh, the usual. I claimed the bounty on a Brood hitman and Sorc sent more hired guns after me.
Oh, the usual. Multi-tasking, a good memory, the gift of the gab. Not to mention the mixology itself.
Oh, there you are!
Oh, there you are!
Oh, these samples are just right. Great work finding them, Cal.
Oh, they are not gonna like that.
Oh, they were right: what a view!
Oh, they'll tell some real tales about us.
Oh, they'll tell such stories about us one day.
Oh, they've got plenty of reasons!
Oh, thinks he's clever. Well, lad, what if I wanted to go swimmin'?
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is too easy.
Oh, this one wants to fight!
Oh, this'll sting.
Oh, those are not supposed to come off!
Oh, those spikes are dangerous!
Oh, uh, not yet.
Oh, uh, okay okay okay, heh.
Oh, uh, okay. Got it.
Oh, uh...very impressive.
Oh, very funny. Hey, did you visit Coruscant during your travels, Merrin?
Oh, wait, oh, uh, oh.
Oh, we could tell you some stories.
Oh, we got it all figured out. Got a map and everything!
Oh, we gotta hear this. You holdin' out on us, sister?
Oh, we're not talking about the general degradation.
Oh, we've all been watching, Cal. Not every newcomer introduces themselves by taking down one of Rayvis' boys.
Oh, we've seen a lot of each other's character over the years. I doubt the kid needs any more from me.
Oh, well the flight suit protects me, but yeah - I can feel it a little.
Oh, well, count on you to prove me wrong, Cal. When we were all ready to fold, you never stopped fighting.
Oh, well. Okay then.
Oh, well. Uh. That's insubordination!
Oh, what a helpful droid.
Oh, what's the point?
Oh, what's this now?
Oh, what, ye think you could do better? Go on, then!
Oh, when I find you...
Oh, where's the fun in that?
Oh, who asked you anyway?
Oh, wow!
Oh, wow.
Oh, wrong planet then.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, it was bad! Weequay pirates. I tried every evasive move in the book, full throttle, couldn't lose them.
Oh, yeah, okay they're done.
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll ask around, see if anyone's got a death wish. Maybe Turgle?
Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thanks.
Oh, yeah? Well, let's get his take: what do you propose we do, Cal?
Oh, yes! Fight!
Oh, yes, I feel so fortunate.
Oh, yes. Of course. Got it. 
Oh, yes. Well we're going to finish that job.
Oh, you Jedi truly know how to fight!
Oh, you are good.
Oh, you can shoot!
Oh, you don't know what you're in for, do you?
Oh, you felt that.
Oh, you got a little spice in you! That's quite the thing to see, in a droid.
Oh, you know. Tax-free trade, extrajudicial imports, what have you.
Oh, you little...
Oh, you little...
Oh, you must have been so frightened that they'd discover you.
Oh, you name it: Colo claw roe, deep-fried nuna legs, ormachek.
Oh, you said it! Follow Cal long enough and you'll end up getting a tour of the weirdest destinations in the galaxy.
Oh, you scared?
Oh, you think you're slick, huh?
Oh, you want it?
Oh, you weren't kidding!
Oh, you'll regret that.
Oh, you're big!
Oh, you're done for.
Oh, you're fun!
Oh, you're goin' down. 
Oh, you're goin' down. 
Oh, you're here, good! I wanted to get your feedback on some new moves of mine.
Oh, you're in trouble. 
Oh, you're in trouble. 
Oh, you're in trouble. 
Oh, you're in trouble. 
Oh, you're not getting away.
Oh, you're on!
Oh, you're on!
Oh, you've got some fight, huh?
Oh, you've killed them all.
Oh, you.
Oh-ho! Lad, yer a crack-up! Haha!
Oh-ho! Tha's one fer Skoova Stev!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh. Actually, yeah, that happened.
Oh. But then I won't see the scenery.
Oh. Good.
Oh. Great.
Oh. Hey. 
Oh. Hmph.
Oh. I get it.
Oh. I suppose that makes sense. I think?
Oh. I take it you haven't broken the news yet.
Oh. I think I understand.
Oh. I was trying to remember all the birds from back on Birren.
Oh. I won. That's good!
Oh. I'll start now, then.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Oh. Is he as tough as he looks?
Oh. It's you. 
Oh. Not fun.
Oh. Ohhhh. That helps, thank you!
Oh. Okay, thanks Monk. Good talk.
Oh. Okay.
Oh. Okay.
Oh. Okay. Alright then.
Oh. Okay. Am I? Answer me. Hey, answer me, that's an order!
Oh. Roger, roger.
Oh. Roger, roger...
Oh. So I guess this means I'm in command now!
Oh. That is not good.
Oh. That's what I mean, too...
Oh. The Jedi is hurting!
Oh. They're all destroyed.
Oh. This thing is live.
Oh. Those blasted raiders, they take everything!
Oh. Well, I'm sure we'll be victorious!
Oh. Well, uh, okay then. V-very good. Carry on!
Oh. Well, uh, that would be, um, insubordination.
Oh. Well. That's not as fun.
Oh. Yes, of course. We'll definitely win.
Oh. You mean smuggling.
Oh. You think?
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...hey there.
Oh...my designs. They're lost forever.
Oh...the ground, some bushes, you!
Oh...yeah. Right. Okay.
Oh?
Oh?
Oh?
Oh? Our understanding of the higher mysteries is always in motion.
Ohh, fun!
Ohh, not like this!
Ohh, this is fun!
Ohh, this will be fun.
Ohhh boy. Owch.
Ohhh no you don't!
Ohhh!
Ohhh!
Ohhh, it's a bilemaw charge!
Ohhh, it's on now!
Ohhh, not good.
Ohhh, she's very sneaky, very confusing.
Ohhh, so we just need to keep hunting them down!
Ohhh, so you've fought a Jedi before then? Right? Uh, right?
Ohhh. See a lightsaber, open fire. Got it!
Ohhhh yeah!
Ohhhh. I get it! Understood. The ship will be liberated.
Ohhhh. That sounds bad.
Ohhhh. What's it mining?
Oho, the ol' fishie won't know what hit 'er!
Oho. This one understands!
Ohoho, Cal, ye - ye kindly lubber. Sometimes I forget yer only half-cooked around the gills.
Ohoho, fear the bilemaw!
Ohoho, take this!
Oi!
Oi!
Oi, Cal! Good to see ya.
Oi, Cal! Heard you gave Rayvis the sack!
Oi, Cal! Think it's time I told you more about the old days. Got a moment?
Oi, Skoova - 'aven't we met?
Ok, Jedi! Fight me!
Ok, he's gone. Back to patrol. 
Ok, thats enough out of both of you.
Okay Cal.
Okay I got it.
Okay Monk. Maybe this wasn't clear the first time. You may be in charge while I'm gone, but there are rules.
Okay here you go, round two.
Okay let's see. I have no upper body strength.
Okay now I'm mad.
Okay now I'm mad.
Okay okay! You're not very fun.
Okay then.
Okay then.
Okay then. 
Okay then...
Okay we'll check him out.
Okay well, hopefully, you'll be back for the others soon enough!
Okay you're right, I just like to look at the flames...
Okay!
Okay! Switching to stealth mode!
Okay, Anchorites. Listen up, I'll explain salt. It helps bring the flavor forward and...and...
Okay, Cal. We're comin' in.
Okay, I lied. I'm fresh out. I'm a failure!
Okay, I think they're dead. 
Okay, I won't tell you.
Okay, I'll catch you later.
Okay, I'll look.
Okay, I'm ready.
Okay, I'm ready.
Okay, I'm thinking of a number between one and a million...
Okay, Monk. Lay it on me. Who's got an outstanding debt around here?
Okay, a few years ago, the Supreme Chancellor decided democracy was out of fashion and declared himself Emperor.
Okay, but don't get so caught up that you miss the small things.
Okay, but if I don't, that's the end of the story.
Okay, but it's on you if it doesn't fire.
Okay, but you're gonna be disappointed!
Okay, but you're moving right now.
Okay, do you remember what we do when we see a Jedi?
Okay, getting closer.
Okay, good luck.
Okay, good to know.
Okay, here's a deal. If we get through this without gettin' sliced apart?
Okay, let me think...
Okay, let's focus. Zee needs us.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, let's listen!
Okay, let's scope out the way across.
Okay, let's see what we have here.
Okay, let's take their food to go.
Okay, let's try it again.
Okay, let's try it out.
Okay, look out for that.
Okay, look, it was dark. Things were screeching. What do you want from me?
Okay, no funny business, just put the scrap down and your hands up!
Okay, now let's find a way out of this tar pit.
Okay, now try me.
Okay, now what?
Okay, now, boy.
Okay, now.
Okay, now.
Okay, off ya go. Don't be a stranger.
Okay, okay, don't go too wild, kid. He's made some fine changes, sure, but I'm not handing over the keys just yet.
Okay, okay, okay. Let's do this!
Okay, okay, we can do this.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay. I can take a hint.
Okay, okay. Sorry I asked.
Okay, okay. You're a good friend, Cal.
Okay, on route to Koboh.
Okay, right, good to know.
Okay, so next...
Okay, so not that way.
Okay, so they explode.
Okay, so this is us and... this is Greez?
Okay, thanks for the warning.
Okay, that hurt.
Okay, that sounds promising.
Okay, that was impressive.
Okay, that's brutal.
Okay, the seed is in.
Okay, then. I'll fight you myself.
Okay, this Jedi is a serious threat.
Okay, this is high!
Okay, this is us. This must be the outpost.
Okay, this is...really impressive.
Okay, this time.
Okay, we're here. 
Okay, we're not doing this.
Okay, we've got the lay of the land.
Okay, well, if you're not sharing stories, we'll -
Okay, what do we got?
Okay, what should we listen to?
Okay, what?
Okay, what?
Okay, wow!
Okay, wow...
Okay, you came to play
Okay, you can fight.
Okay, you're annoying me now.
Okay, you're boring me.

Okay. Be careful.
Okay. He's running away. 
Okay. I did it.
Okay. It's done.
Okay. Let's pick our next destination.
Okay. No, I can figure this out...
Okay. Not that way, then.
Okay. Okay, I got this? I got this.
Okay. Should be set for the night.
Okay. So Greez is on the other side of all this?
Okay. Sorry, then.
Okay. Thank you. Really. I just, you know. Still trying to accept things. That helped.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay. That's new. 
Okay. Time to end this. 
Okay. We'll take care of the Mantis.
Okay. What?
Okay. You don't look like the other prospectors.
Okay. You just stay safe.
Okay. You two grab some seat, I got the con.
Okay...
Okay...
Okay...
Okay... I was tracking something.
Okay...maybe you'll be a bit more friendly now?
Okay...okay.
Okay...still, I want to leave.
Ol' Caij just up and disappeared.
Old Aratech speeder bikes.
Old coot.
Old friend of ours. Top-notch engineer. Had a winning smile, too.
Old loading dock. Back from when things were busy 'round here.
Old tech is less conspicuous.
On 'em, on 'em!
On Coruscant, I found Imperial intel.
On Coruscant, others would construct my designs.
On Dathomir we did not have cities, like Coruscant. So the stars were almost overwhelming in number.
On Koboh, too. They're everywhere.
On Tanalorr?
On account of my good looks.
On alert. Systems ready.
On him!
On him!
On him! Now!
On him! Now!
On him.
On it!
On it!
On it!
On it, Kestis.
On it.
On it.
On it.
On it.
On it.
On it.
On it.
On it. 
On it. 
On it. 
On it. 
On me!
On me!
On me.
On mission.
On my lead!
On my mark hit the brakes, we'll drop behind 'em
On my target!
On my target.
On my way.
On my way.
On my way. 
On my way. 
On second thought, I could use some exercise. Sure, we'll go later, promise.
On second thought, I'm good.
On second thought, how's about I tell you all that after that oil bath?
On second thought, no. No I do not.
On second thought, patrolling sounds great.
On second thought...no.
On shores of silt, a river winds, a bank of guilt, a broken bind.
On target.
On target. 
On target. 
On task.
On task. 
On that we can agree.
On the Jedi's trail. 
On the Shattered Moon,
On the comms. Now.
On the contrary, it means our purpose is noticed. If we survive this trial, our victory is all but assured.
On the enemy.
On the floo - um...whatever. Just keep the place running until I come back!
On the ground!
On the ground!
On the ground!
On the hunt for hostiles.
On the hunt. 
On the job.
On the move. 
On the offensive!
On the offensive!
On the run, huh? What'd you do?
On the target. 
On their six.
On them! For Dathomir!
On this rock? Good luck.
On to Rayvis.
On to the next one?
On you, BD-1.
On you, BD.
On your feet!
On your feet, soldier!
On your guard.
On your knees!
On your knees!
On your signal.
On your toes 'round that one.
On your toes 'round this thing!
On your toes - it jumps!
On your way.
On your word.
On-target!
Once I defeat our enemies, I'm gonna go see another planet!
Once Sorc learns your role in taking down the Haxion Brood, who knows what he'll pay for you.
Once Tanalorr is ready, we'll come back for them.
Once Tanalorr is secure. And we will need more compasses.
Once a new location is secured, these codes will help us contact the network.
Once a rat, always a rat!
Once more.
Once or twice.
Once or twice. I'd be careful out there - that's gang turf.
Once or twice. Usually before something bad happened.
Once the Empire occupied my planet, it seized my nursery, uprooting every flower, fern, and sapling.
Once we are on Tanalorr, perhaps we can dream up a new war, you and I.
Once we cross the Abyss, Tanalorr could be a bastion to repel that threat.
Once we get through this, Kata and I can finally rest.
Once we nab this bounty, you should take it up with the bosses up top. Like to see that.
Once we nab this bounty, you should take it up with the bosses up top. Like to see that.
Once we're outta here, first thing is payin' a visit to Doma Dendra...
Once, during the Kashyyyk uprisings. I used a bowcaster.
Once, just once I'd like things to go smoothly. 
Once. I found it...enlightening.
Once. Used to be a settlement. Now it's just a bunch of crumbling stone spires and creepy ruins.
One I can't talk about.
One arm down.
One big, dead, lump of credits.
One built by those who revered Force Users. We know little about them, but I found the experience quite fascinating.
One compass remains.
One compass remains.
One day I dream of joining Rayvis' personal guard.
One day I'll be in charge of so much more.
One day Kata and I were out running errands and I got this message.
One day, there will no Jedi left, and this galaxy will finally know true peace.
One day, we'll do it.
One dead Jedi. And another notch on my belt.
One down.
One down. 
One dusty prospector after another, hoping to strike it rich on old tech or priorite.
One even an old man like myself has much to learn from.
One falls!
One for each of us.
One for you, one for me.
One goes down!
One heck of a lady...
One hit and you're gonna feel it. 
One in the chamber for ya!
One last jump. It's a big one.
One last normal flight before we propel ourselves into who-knows-what?
One left.
One less Imperial.
One less Jedi. 
One less Jedi. Silver linings, I suppose.
One less annoyance
One less battle bot!
One less bug to deal with
One less critter.
One less critter.
One less distraction.
One less droid.
One less enemy.
One less insurgent to deal with. 
One less of us.
One less pest - let's go say thank you.
One less pest.
One less pest.
One less problem.
One less stinkin' bug.
One less thing to worry about.
One less thing to worry about.
One less traitor.
One less weapon for the Empire.
One less.
One moment.
One moment.
One moment.
One moment.
One more and it's over.
One more day, one more kill.
One more time -- for posterity!
One more time.
One more time.
One more to go, chump.
One more win for the Empire.
One more word and I'll end you right where you stand.
One o' the tentacles twitched into the air, just over ma head, and then - wham!
One of You
One of few in the galaxy.
One of my old crew - a mate on the Grapnel - once tried tae pluck a crab from the sea-foam, when suddenly...
One of the Bedlam Raider chiefs used to shoot 'em for fun.
One of them fools hollering at me to throw a 'Raiders are gone' party.
One of who?
One of your armor clasps is unbuckled.
One of your regulars clued me in on his game.
One or two. A lot more Venators.
One piece at a time!
One remains.
One ring at a time, Kata. One ring at a time.
One second.
One stands, one falls!
One step at a time?
One step behind!
One sun sets, another rises - hotter, brighter, blinding!
One thing this place could use is a kitchen.
One thing you'll learn about business: a customer is a customer, even if your customer is Turgle.
One was tall and quiet, one short and babbling. They had stopped to inspect some beastly carcass.
One way door.
Only I deserve Tanalorr.
Only I remain.
Only Jedi carry lightsabers.
Only Jedi carry those weapons!
Only Jedi know the Force.
Only Jedi use Force powers.
Only a Jedi fights like this.
Only a few more shots. 
Only a matter of time before he made his move. But I'm not an easy mark, Cal! You should know that by now.
Only a matter of time before they replace all of us with droids.
Only a rumor if it isn't true.
Only always! But I owe these Zabrak quite a few credits for an...incident I was involved in.
Only destruction can release you from your duty.
Only enough to see there's no way I'm getting inside.
Only faint traces of their passage, heading deep into the Unknown Regions.
Only good skriton is a dead one.
Only if you don't keep your eyes open!
Only my defeat will bring the knowledge you seek!
Only once. 
Only one left standing.
Only one left!
Only one of you will reach Tanalorr.
Only one remains.
Only one way through.
Only one way to find out.
Only one way to find out.
Only one way to find out.
Only one way to get through patrols like this.
Only range remaining.
Only ranged foes remain.
Only ranged units remain!
Only seven? How disappointing. 
Only so I can bring it all crashing down.
Only the powerless seek aid.
Only the weak flee!
Only the weak run.
Only those with authorization learn the ship manifest.
Only through patience, careful thought - and the wisdom of the Force - will the way appear.
Only way forward is to cut through.
Only way is up ahead. And into another firing chamber.
Only way through is the firing chamber.
Only way to go is up.
Only way to survive in this crazy galaxy.
Only way to the Lucrehulk is through this swamp.
Only we remain.
Only what I've seen in visions.
Only what the Council demanded.
Only when he's done with this chores.
Only with a level head and focus will we prevail against a Jedi.
Only with unflinching loyalty will we prevail over those who wish to divide us.
Only you. The others must wait.
Only your strength can best me!
Onward!
Oof!
Oof!
Oof, a tough loss, Cal.
Oof, didn't' know droids could stink.
Oof.
Oof. Hate to be that guy.
Ooh ooh, how about a derelict ship ghost tour?
Ooh! So long, farewell!
Ooh, I got it. Roller mine roller derby!
Ooh, I'd love to see a Dathomirian killer in action. Think she'd want in on our deal?
Ooh, I'll trade shots with ya.
Ooh, I'm scared!
Ooh, MagnaGuard mad now.
Ooh, a dancer!
Ooh, a flying Jedi.
Ooh, a lightsaber - I'm shaking in my jet boots.
Ooh, a tuner k - what?!
Ooh, had to hurt.
Ooh, looks like the book found its spine.
Ooh, nearly!
Ooh, ouch.
Ooh, remember that massive heatwave?
Ooh, someone's interested.
Ooh, stepping up. I like that.
Ooh, that bilemaw means business!
Ooh, that mogu is steamed, steamed, steamed!
Ooh, they did not like that.
Ooh, this... this'll be good.
Ooh, too slow!
Ooh.
Ooh. That's a good one.
Ooh. What kind of tournament?
Ooh...let me just catch my breath...
Oondun took somethin' straight out of me brain...
Ooo-aa-aa!

Out bounty's here. 
Out in the middle of nowhere.
Out in the northern desert, there is a site of great significance; the ruins of a temple of Force worshippers.
Out mark is below us. 
Out o' the water? Blow me over, the lad's a natural! What a catch! Healing powers, ye say?
Out of Viper droids.
Out of artillery...
Out of backup, I don't know if I can handle this.

Out with a bang.
Outcome as expected.
Outer Rim's a tough place. Its selling point was being stormtrooper-free until a few years ago.
Outer Rim, Koboh. But keep your people out of here for now, understand? We're headed off-planet to meet her.
Outlander, we meet again.
Outrageous
Outside of the temple, it's pure wilderness.
Outstanding work.
Outstanding!
Outstanding! Well, you're clearly a savant.
Outstanding.
Outta here.
Outta my way.

P'raps more importantly, the ordeal awoke me to the truth: I had no desire to spear fish nor fisher.
P-Pyloon's Saloon? That lubber-infested waterin' hole down in yon valley?
Pack hunter killed.
Package the body for processing.
Pah!
Pah! He's running scared.
Pah! Not likely.
Pah, an easy kill.
Pah, good.

Parried again.
Parried!
Parry notification.
Part of the Lucrehulk's central sphere.
Part of the job, Kestis.
Partially, but another big reason is that on the frontier, you can reinvent yourself.
Partisans.
Pass.
Pass.
Patching yourself up?
Patching yourself up?

Pay attention to your own blaster, rookie. 
Pay them back, Cere!
Payback time.
Payday's comin'!
Paydirt!
Payload released.
Pazaak. Thought I was hot stuff, so I bought myself entry to one of the fanciest tournaments there is.
Peaceful or not, Imperial resisters will be stomped out.
Pegnuts? You'll be hard-pressed to offload that cargo out here.
People are complicated. Maybe she thought the Order got it wrong.
People are nervous, and I honestly don't blame them.
People change, Sister. Even the ancients.
People go to Koboh after things fall apart, not to put things back together.
People have to learn to defend themselves, Greez. You can't fight their battles for them.
People just seem drawn to you.
People looking after her, but...
People show their affection in strange ways, don't they?
People there are resilient and Doma Dendra won't give up.
People uproot their whole lives, leave their homes, only to settle in smaller, worse towns.
People were more decisive back in my day...
People who - hell, I messed it up. I'm just tryna say...
Perceptive.
Perceptive.
Perfect job for a B1.
Perfect place to hide from the Empire.
Perfect timing!
Perfect timing.
Perfect!
Perfect!
Perfect, buddy. 
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Perfect. 
Perfect. Gotta be careful.
Perfect. That should give our operation cover from Imperial scanners.
Perhaps - but then, she is not one to inflate the truth.
Perhaps Commander Denvik's scheming has gone too far.
Perhaps I should taste test that new concoction. But who?
Perhaps I will.
Perhaps a new stratagem is required...
Perhaps another traveler might find this useful on the path.
Perhaps it was the sparkle that caught ma eye - the sparkle of a passing glumbrig eel!
Perhaps it'll be tomorrow. Perhaps a year from tomorrow. But I fear I must pursue ma dread nemesis one last time.
Perhaps it's just my penchant for optimism, but it's looking like this place might actually be profitable one day.
Perhaps not, but a firestorm serves as the perfect deterrent for those who would cross us.
Perhaps not, but we will figure it out together.
Perhaps our new guests can apprehend the Jedi for us!
Perhaps so, but there's lots of them and not so many of you. It's just facts.
Perhaps some sort of high-propulsion shielding! Cal, did you notice any ablative coating?
Perhaps that isn't your choice.
Perhaps that's wise! Dagan Gera is positively mad! He kept going on and on about some compass.
Perhaps there's something in the satellite laboratory that could help us analyze it.
Perhaps there's something we could do for you in return!
Perhaps these decisions are harder for organics.
Perhaps these might aid you?
Perhaps these trials are intended to reveal a hidden pattern beneath the sands of this barren desert.
Perhaps they were.
Perhaps this Jedi is the very last? I sure don't know of any others.
Perhaps we should be on our way to Cere's base. The desert storms are unpredictable.
Perhaps we will see some of it on our travels. Would you like that?
Perhaps yer wise not to take yer morals from a crab.
Perhaps you are ready to revisit old challenges?
Perhaps you have found a sanctuary for them.
Perhaps you need a more skilled sparring partner.
Perhaps you will too.
Perhaps you will.
Perhaps you'd be best served directing your curiosity towards your studies, Sister.
Perhaps you're not so bad after all.
Perhaps you're right.
Perhaps, but there's nothing saying we can't be brutal either.
Perhaps, lad. And perhaps not.
Perhaps.
Perhaps. But it never hurts to have more.
Perhaps. If we can get to it.
Perhaps. Or perhaps I'll drown my sorrows a little while longer.
Perhaps...though such knowledge would carry its own price.
Perhaps?
Perimeter check complete. Commencing next scan in four minutes 56 seconds.
Perimeter is secure.
Perimeter's locked down. Net's closed.
Perish the thought, hmm?
Perish with the Order.
Perish. 
Persecuted by the Empire, huh? Gonna get crowded.
Persistent.
Personal aerial transportation device damaged.
Personal desires are nothing next to the true calling.
Personal space.
Personally, I think Cal likes stirring up trouble.
Persuaded? Perhaps not, though I was moved. The poetry was inspired.

Pfft. What a waste of a good lightsaber.
Pft. Some Jedi.
Phew! I needed that.
Phew! That was a close one.
Phew! Wasn't me.
Phew, what a day! Hey, let's try to stay at the next place long enough for nap.
Photoreceptor update required.

Pyloon's could be a franchise! A cantina in every system, what do you think?
Pyloon's in all neon. I can almost see it...
Pyloon's is as important to him as the Mantis. That's why he named it after his great-grandma.
Pyloon's is drawing a crowd.
Pyloon's was meant to be a home away from home. But these Raiders are ruining everything.
Pyloon's? A good friend, mentor in many ways, fronted me the credits for the place.
Quality wares. One-hundred percent guaranteed.

Quite so, and another location that Master Cordova spoke of fondly.
Quite so, sir.
Quite so. She believed in the possibility of Dagan's rehabilitation.
Quite so. This one is in the southern desert, and it is quite magnificent.
Quite the breeze, eh?
Quite the climb though.
Quite the selection.
Quite the view, ain't it?
Quite well. She is going to take me hunting sometime.

Right y'are.
Right you are - just two fellow comrades on patrol.
Right!
Right!?
Right, Koboh. Think we can make it?
Right, Skoova - you think I could pull off a voorpak or summathat? Just a li'l one, right here on my shoulder?
Right, got it. But the food was okay at least?
Right, that would be terrible.
Right, the manual. I was going to read that. But I get flight sickness so-
Right, who's next?
Right.

Right. My mistake.
Right. No way "we're" quittin' now.
Right. Of course.
Right. Okay. Just get back to patrol.
Right. Thank you, sir. I'm okay now. I'm ready. Following your lead.
Right. Thanks again, Greez.
Right. This is BD.
Right. Totally normal answer. How's it look in those visions?
Right. Whatever it is, we're too close.
Right...
Right... Come on, BD. This is going nowhere.
Right... right... Good to know. I think...
Right?
Right?
Right? I knew you cared about her.
Rip it apart!
Rip it apart!
Ripped apart that B2.
Ripped its shell right off
Rise early, fall late!

Roller droid busted.
Rolling over is not a sign of submission! Don't ask how I know that.
Roof's caving in!

Rookie mistake.
Rookie troopers are four times as likely to die on first their patrols.
Root out any survivors!
Rotate that one more time.
Rough landing.
Rough terrain ahead. Run an approach assessment.
Round and match to Cal!
Round three already? I've lost count.
Rub some dust on it.

Sabacc rematch?
Saber can't be beat.
Saber cut into MagnaGuard.
Saber's are still dangerous!
Sabotaging weapons depots,
Sad to say I have not had the opportunity, but I did hear Master Khri speak of it.
Sad. It brought me back to Dathomir. When I was alone.
Safe house?
Safe is good, lad. Not too safe, mind ye - no fisher ever made a livin' without a family tae feed, they say.
Safe travels, Cal Kestis.
Safe travels, Cal.
Safe travels, Tulakt.
Safe travels. And if Dagan Gera can chart that flight, then I know you can, too.
Safe travels. Bring me back something nice!
Safer than going on foot.
Safer, too.
Safest way outta here.
Safety protocols require one person to remain here while the arrays are active.
Sage advice.

Same as always, trooper. And don't call me sir.
Same as always.
Same as anyone else, without all the guilt.
Same as it ever was.
Same as it was two minutes ago - all clear.
Same as us, really.
Same as you. Made a name for myself, for better or worse, needed out of the game before it caught up with me.
Same here, brother.
Same here.
Same old tricks!
Same thing that happens to anything caught between the hammer and the anvil.
Same with all the other changes: resigned annoyance.
Sannet Ot'Zien was appointed Republic ambassador to the Orrik Cluster, which had just been identified as populated.
Sannet was escorted by a contingent of Republic starfighters. Everyone expected a confrontation.
Santari Khri does.
Santari Khri lead the way.
Santari Khri led the research team.
Santari Khri said it held the key to Tanalorr. Zee seems to think so, too.
Santari Khri was training Jedi for the journey through the Abyss.
Santari Khri's observatory. As Dagan suspected.

Save me.
Save some for me.
Save that Jedi for me! I want to deliver him to Dagan myself.
Save that righteous fire for our enemies.
Save the Jedi for me!
Save the Jedi for me!
Save your complaints, we have a galaxy to protect.
Save your energy for me.

Saved the best for last, eh?
Saving the best for last?
Saving up for a new speeder.
Saw a couple scouts sniffing around, but I think they took a good long look at Merrin's dagger and thought twice.
Saw a pack of springers today.
Saw it myself. I took care of it.
Saw my share of Jedi in the past. Fine warriors, though a little too pretentious if you ask me.
Saw some spikers nesting nearby.
Saw that coming.
Saw them on Mareg IX. You never seen so many yurts.
Saw those Raiders shootin' at you!
Saw you take a couple blaster bolts back there. How are you still standing?
Say Cal...what's Tanalorr like?

Say goodbye!
Say goodbye!
Say goodnight.
Say goodnight.
Say hi to your friends for me.
Say it again and I'll cut out your tongue.
Say it again, will ya?
Say no more! With danger all about, what this place needs is a hero!
Say no more.
Say that again and you'll wish you hadn't.
Say the word when you want to go after Bode. This isn't over yet.
Say the word!
Say the word, Cal.
Say we catch Bode. What do you think we should do?
Say we short the central conduit, slice it through the emergency couplings?
Say what now?
Say what?
Say your enemies are closing in fast, with blasters drawn and murder in their eyes.
Say, 'Here's hoping we stay spineless and avoid sudden moves so those Raiders don't blast us'?
Say, Cal - know anything about that beam of light coming from the forest?
Say, Cal, it's looking a little roomy over in Caij's booth - don't suppose you know where she's gotten to?
Say, Cal, what do you make of this place?
Say, I never told you how I got out of that bind with Sorc, did I?
Say, Kata, would you like to hear about my Great Grandma Pyloon?
Say, Monk, you look awful busy.
Say, uh, Jetpack, give me a hand up here.
Say, where is the Mantis in there?
Say, why don't I see what snacks I have tucked away in the cockpit?
Say, why don't you make up your mind, old boy?
Say, you lookin' for work? Grock and I have a talent for turning opportunity into profit.

See, BD? She's friendly.
See, It needs to simmer to a cool before you add any flavor.
See, ol' Tendo goes and buys the worst claim in the region. 'Bout as likely to find a payday there as in your breakfast.
See, that is exactly why I don't want to be here.
See, that makes me mad.
See, this droid gets it.
See, we love Koboh and all, but..
See? I'm not so bad.
See? Kid gets it.
Seeds. Can't do anything with it without a garden.
Seeds. Could be useful in the garden, right?
Seeds. I could plant them. But where?
Seeds. Let's plant these next time we're in the garden.
Seeds. Let's take them back to the garden. Pili could tell us more.
Seeds. Now, if we only had somewhere to plant them.
Seeds. We should find somewhere to plant them.
Seeds. What do you think, BD, bring 'em back to the garden?
Seeds. Wonder if Pili has more info at our garden.
Seeds? Wonder where I could plant these.
Seeing a lot of new faces about these days!
Seeing the cantina empty out, it's making me nostalgic about how this whole thing started.
Seeing these High Republic ruins with my own eyes...how do you go back to the academy after that?
Seeing these battle droids about takes one back, doesn't it?
Seeing this place start to get its legs feels like...the start of something historic.
Seek and destroy.
Seek and destroy.
Seek me out or go to Tanalorr.
Seek me out or go to Tanalorr.
Seek only where you wish to go, not where you long to have been.
Seeking an aerial advantage.
Seemed like there was some tension between you and Cere, huh?
Seems durable, right?
Seems excessive.
Seems he has a vested interest in the project here.
Seems ironic, we're all the way down here, trying to reach through the stars.
Seems it liked you.
Seems like Cal will have to review and adjust his strategy.
Seems like an easy choice.
Seems like every time you're set to kick the gravball, they pull it away.
Seems like everyone who tries to be your friend dies.
Seems like it's a Jedi.
Seems like that was our last Probe Droid.
Seems like the Raider problem here is gettin' worse on the daily.
Seems like the harder I work, the more things go wrong.
Seems like they left in a hurry.
Seems like you and Doma have some history.
Seems like you're all settling in on Koboh.
Seems like you're happy here. I like seeing that, bud.
Seems like you're hurt.
Seems like you've got a nice crew. Former crew. You know what I mean.
Seems like you've got a nice crew. Former crew. You know what I mean.

Seriously, Greez. If you ever want to give your arm an upgrade, just say the word.
Seriously, I have gastrointestinal problems.
Seriously, what is that whole situation?
Seriously?
Seriously?
Seriously? To a rawka?
Seriously? Where'd he go?
Seriously? Where'd he go?
Serves that monster right!
Set forth, Cal!
Set me on them!
Set upon them!
Setting it on fire is sounding better by the second.
Several Republic picket ships had been destroyed near the Cluster...
Several patrols have been reported missing recently.
Severed at the shoulder joint!
Shadows can't hide you now.
Shady deals? Please, Cal, shady deals are so Old Turgle. I'm fully on the path of self-improvement now.
Shake that off.
Shall we continue me sordid tale?
Shall we...play a game?
Shame a droid like you will never be loved by Rayvis.
Shame!
Shame, we could have developed some real synergy.
Shame.
Shame.
Shame. No one will see me in my glory.
Shame. No one will see me kill you.
Shame. This place has potential.
Sharp enough to see the Jedi might be your equal.
Sharper than I thought. No matter. Kill him.
Shattered Moon it is.
Shattered Moon. No sweat.
She ain't a woman you'd wanna cross.
She always just knew what I needed. Don't know how.
She always knows where to guide me. Even if I don't know my next step.
She anticipated it!
She anticipates their attacks!
She called me a bucket of bolts. That is insulting.
She could do with more regular maintenance. But I couldn't ask for a better ship.
She defeated Dagan but didn't turn him in. Why?
She defends us!
She deflected the attack!
She did it!
She didn't at first.
She dodged!
She doesn't even blink.
She doesn't even need one.
She doesn't look retired.
She eluded me fer years before I packed ma satchel and headed home to Sakavi Tar.
She fights back hard.
She gives me a lot of credit.
She had no choice!
She had such faith in him.
She headed up to the landing pad when the Mantis came in.
She implores Cal to finish the mission her master charged her with:
She is an innocent in all this. We must not make her pay for the crimes of her father.
She is reinvigorated.
She likes you.
She looked at me. No, into me. Like she was staring at my soul!
She lost all long-range communications, and was stranded just inside the Cluster, separated from her military escort.
She made her choices, but, if it helps us find a home that's free of the Empire, so be it.
She makes everyone feel safer.
She may be gone, Greez, but I'll never forget that.
She must have been really lost. Or desperate to find her way.
She paraded the Rayfish at a gala, and the guest of honor - a senator -
She parries!
She protects us!
She purged that knowledge from your memory.
She put something in your brain?
She said I was a "harbinger of chaos," and wherever I walked, "so trouble followed." Or something.
She said it brought out the mocha in my eyes. What do you think?
She say anything?
She shoots from the hip but her aim ain't half bad, so close in for the kill as soon as you spot her.
She stopped it!
She sure is. Everyone from her time is ancient history, and she just keeps on going.
She sure was one for advice, wasn't she?
She takes after her mother.
She taught me so much.
She tell you about the High Republic mystery tucked in the basement?
She that good?
She unloaded a mag' into the back kitchen.
She used to love to watch the cruisers as they left the spaceport.
She uses their fire against them!
She was a special lady.
She was discovered by a passing Orrik ship, and could not escape before it overtook her...
She was talking about the chamber, Zee.
She was trapped underground.
She will be safe.
She would have liked you, Kata.
She'd say 'Captain Dritus, did you forget to tune that starboard stabilizer, again?'
She'll sell you out too.
She's a force of nature, huh?
She's a friend.
She's a hard one to read. You however, couldn't be more obvious. So what are you waiting for?
She's alright!
She's alright! Watch her back!
She's always there for me when it counts.
She's been changing skylane traffic.
She's been hit!
She's been keeping tabs on the Haxion Brood, so this time we've got the jump on him.
She's deflecting!
She's far too busy.
She's from Dathomir. And she can perform magick.
She's got a green thumb.
She's got her path, I've got mine.
She's got one!
She's healing - cover her!
She's hit!
She's holding one!
She's hurt!
She's injured!
She's my pride and joy!
She's not much younger than we were when our families were taken from us.
She's our chief archivist - and, though I doubt she'd admit it, she seems eager to meet you.
She's recovering!
She's regaining her strength!
She's resilient, that droid. Where's she now?
She's right - now's the time to make our move.
She's right. Now's our time to move.
She's so fast!
She's untouchable!
She's very busy with this new project.
Sheeboo sheeboo!
Sheesh, you figure that guy would let things go by now...
Sheesh. Relax. We haven't seen anything for days.

Shiverpede? That's right, right?
Shiverpedes. Ugh.
Shock 'em!
Shock 'em!
Shock that one!
Shock this thing, it deserves it.

Shoot. That ain't gonna heal. Sorry, hon. Not your day.
Shooters wiped out.

Shortcut, nice.
Shortly after ma promotion, we were on our way tae Manaan tae sell the carcass of a gooberfish.
Shots fired!
Shots fired.
Shots fired. Roger, roger.
Should I be worried?
Should I go find a big stick to poke it with?
Should I have a shield?
Should I, uh, should we be worried?
Should a Jedi descend upon us, I will hold against them until they are dead, or I am.
Should be able to get that orb out now. Let's take it back to the wave coupler.
Should be. Who'd want to be on this forsaken planet?
Should make this look vibrant.
Should that concern us?
Should we fire on the shell?
Should we give it a shot?
Should we go with this?
Should we investigate?
Should we move up?
Should we open fire?
Should we shoot him?
Should we take 'em on?
Should you be forced to confront it, do not trust its movements. It strikes suddenly and in quick succession.
Should you find any datadiscs from my day, I'd be happy to decrypt them for you!
Should you find any scrolls or other items of import, please bring them to me.
Should you happen upon any scrolls or other objects of interest...
Should you restore full power, we can use that crane to remove this unsightly wreckage!
Should you venture into the murkier regions of the highlands, you could find yourself in the lair of a Sutaban Alpha.
Should've kept your nose out of this one.
Should've run when you had the chance.
Should've seen that one coming.
Should've stayed away.
Shouldn't grow any further than that.
Shouldn't have come here. 
Shouldn't have played with fire.
Shouldn't linger too long.
Shouldn't you be heading out, Cal?
Shouldn't you be out gallivanting on distant planets, tracking down the mysteries of Tanalorr?
Shove 'em back!
Shove off!
Show 'em the way, Greez.
Show 'em who's boss here!
Show caution, but never fear!

Side step successful.
Side-stepping Inquisitors, one-upping Vader. The guy's playing a dangerous game.
Silence
Silence your vocabulator and move out.
Silence! I know!
Silence. Something is here.
Silence. You are not in command here.
Silence. Your excuses are not required.
Silent, haunting, and lethal.
Simmer down.
Simple dodge.
Simple.
Simple.
Simply exceptional!
Simulating high five.
Simulations, huh? Well ain't that somethin'. Will see how you fare 'gainst the real thing, won't we?
Since I was a child, I've always enjoyed the company of plants. In my adolescence, I joined a well-respected nursery.
Since then, I've been the closest thing to a mayor this town has.
Since what?
Since when did Rayvis take orders from anybody?
Sink yer eyes on this...
Sir!?
Sir, I feel my position at this outpost is wasted. My skill could be used elsewhere.
Sir, I've found something.
Sir, I've seen your combat skills. They are impressive. How often do you train?
Sir, can you explain why we're out this far in the Rim?
Sir, do you have any advice on fighting the Jedi?
Sir, excuse me. I wanted to mention that if there is anything you need, I'm ready.
Sir, how do you stay motivated?
Sir, if I may.
Sir, if you don't mind me asking, did you fight in the Clone Wars?
Sir, once operations here are underway, I would appreciate a recommendation to remain.
Sir, uh, permission to speak freely?
Sir?
Sir?
Sister Taske informed me.
Sister Taske would be impressed, huh?
Sister, were you persuaded by the fifth corollary?
Sit down, kid. It's time to land. 
Sit down, we're here.
Sit still!
Sit still, wouldya?
Sit still.
Sit tight, BD. Let me see what I can do.
Sit tight, you two. I'll find Cere's contact.
Sit. Tell me what adventures you and BD have had since we last saw each other.
Sithspit! This thing isn't going anywhere.
Sithspit.
Sithspit. The way is blocked.
Sittin' alone in a pod in deep space with nothin' but a tank of old cod an' gash.
Situation deteriorating.
Situation is deteriorating.
Skies are emptying. I don't like it.
Skilled combatant.
Skillful response. 
Skoova, hey. What's waiting beneath the surface this time?
Skoova, mate - you hear about the Gen'Dai?
Skriton decimated.
Skriton down!
Skriton down! 
Skriton here! A tough one.
Skriton here, let's get it!
Skriton in the area.
Skriton inbound
Skriton over here...
Skriton spotted.
Skriton! Keep your distance!
Skriton! Move!
Skriton's are the most feared creatures in the desert, which is saying something!
Skriton.
Skylane accident. They think it could have been terrorists.
Skylane detours. Apparently traffic control's going haywire.
Slayed a gorroco! Now that's expert hunting, my friend.
Sleeping with one eye open.
Sleight of hand, huh? I saw a merchant on Corellia do that.
Slice 'em, now!
Slice damage repaired.
Slice it to ribbons!
Slice it.
Slice that droid.
Sliced him in half!
Sliced in two.
Sliced it to pieces!
Slick!
Slick.
Slick.
Slight damage.
Slightly more boring than this patrol.
Slink off before you regret it.
Slink off.
Slipped up. 
Slippery little thing.
Slippery!
Slippery...
Slippery...
Slippery...
Sloppy aim.
Sloppy, Cal.
Sloppy.
Sloppy.
Sloppy.
Slow and steady.
Slow as always.
Slow as always.
Slow down, boy.
Slow down, now.
Slow down.
Slow it down, boy.
Slow up, enemies nearby.
Slow.
Slow.
Slow.
Slow. 
Slower, now.
Slowing their advance.
Sluggish!
Sluggish!
Small army, huh? We're ready.
Small crowd today.
Small world. You let me fish with you, right?
Smart choice.
Smart move would be high ground.
Smart.
Smart.
Smart. I made that mistake once, never again.
Smart. Once we go, who knows if we'll come back.
Smash it till it's dead.
Smash them, don't shoot them!
Smash.
Smell? What smell? You could eat off this ship! But don't, I'm trying to keep it clean!
Smells good. Been years since we shared a meal.
Smiling Salpu! Now one day, he hits an absolute jackpot of priorite!
Smooth!
Snap out of it!
Snap out of it.
Snatching attacker.
Sneaking around down there, Jedi?
Sniff 'em out!
Snitmice get everywhere.
Snuffed out the flame support.
Snuffed them out.
So Coruscant turned out to be a creative dead end, huh?
So Grock may have left an anonymous tip with the authorities.
So I hear.
So I hear.
So I hopped on a tramp freighter, never looked back.
So I left with the Grapnel, thinking the business done. I would be a fisher for Captain Whett.
So I opened ma wee mouth and emitted the mating call of the eel! Uyoooooooiiii!
So I was thinking, you head there and check things out, we split whatever you find fifty-fifty!
So I'm rusty.
So Koboh's a gold mine for scrappers like us.
So Skoova, back to your story.
So Skoova, what ever happened with the pirates?
So Zee.
So a lightsaber. I always wondered, are they weapons of pure light, or-
So acrobatic!
So agile!
So angry!
So angry, Cal!
So are we.
So are we.
So away we swam - Captain Whett, the crew, an' meself.
So c'mon, kid. What's next for ya?
So deadly...
So disappointing!
So do I.
So do you.
So does the Council.
So easy to read.
So easy!
So easy.
So far Koboh has been a welcoming home. And this rooftop's energy drew me towards it.
So far so good, right?
So far so good.
So far, no enemies encountered.
So far, so good.
So far, the skinny's that they're on the move, looking for something.
So fast!
So fast!
So fast!
So fast.
So flimsy, so depressing.
So fragile...
So get back before I forget my orders and we see how tough you really are.
So great to see you!
So have you, old boy. Why not take a break?
So he was Haxion Brood.
So how did the outpost get its start?
So how did you become a music producer?
So how did you end up on the wrong side of the law?
So how did you get rid of them?
So how do ye fight slippery? By bein' muckle slippery yerself!
So how do you go from making sounds on Riosa to becoming a producer?
So how is Koboh? You get away from it all like you wanted?
So how long have you known Bode?
So how long have you known Cal?
So how'd you escape?
So how'd you get involved with the Hidden Path?
So how'd you like playing on Coruscant?
So how'd you track it?
So how'd you two meet, anyway?
So if the droids go in first, I can hang back. Or! I can strike the Jedi in the side, quick, the old one-two.
So if we're attacked, get up nice and close.
So impressive!
So impressive!
So is Greez. (If you move his favorite cleaning rag...)
So it has.
So it took a little time.
So it was them who brought down the shuttle!
So it's the unique flora and fauna?
So it's true.
So just between you and me - let's keep the light shows to one a week. Otherwise, I'll be out of business!
So just two arms, huh?
So let me guess, back to Koboh?
So long as I get my credits, it's none of my concern.
So long as the challenge is great, I will never relent.
So long as we have unwavering faith, no enemy can stop us. Not even a Jedi.
So long as we hold fast, the galaxy will stay safe under our watch.
So long as we're still on the same side, that doesn't bother me.
So long as you're doing your duty, I don't know what there is to be nervous about.
So long for now! I've got opponents waiting for you when you return!
So long!
So long!
So long, Cal.
So long, Jedi!
So long, bud.
So long, champion.
So long.
So many Jedi...they all met the same fate.
So many have died.
So many here are starving. Hungry for more Priorite, more credits, more land. No one is content where they are.
So many lights.
So many lives...I can still hear their cries.
So many people have left, Cal!
So many traditions, extinct. And yet, it might prove the Empire's downfall.
So me, and Ol' Impy walk the Koboh plains for hours. We're walking, and walking, and walking, and walking-
So modest, this one. We pair perfectly, darling.
So much beeping.
So much destruction!
So much for BX droids!
So much for BX droids!
So much for Jedi humility.
So much for a noble beast demanding great respect.
So much for an 'elite' droid.
So much for that defense!
So much for that shell.
So much for the B2s.
So much for the lightsaber.
So much for their gunners!
So much for those battle droids!
So much for those blockheads.
So much for those blockheads.
So much for those commando units.
So much for those destroyer droids.
So much for those destroyer droids.
So much for those probes.
So much has transpired since we first met.
So much power!
So much to do, so much to do.
So next, maybe...
So nimble!
So obvious.
So obvious.
So on your whole journey, uh, finding yourself.
So our expedition is a no-go?
So powerful!
So quick!
So quick...
So run along Jedi!
So satisfying!
So serious!
So she taught you too?
So slippery!
So slow!
So slow!
So soon?
So tender you'll want to buy it dinner...
So that's a no.
So that's us. Just a couple runaway songsters with a thing for glider sounds.
So that's where I went.
So that's where we need to be too.
So that's where you settled down.
So the Anchorites seek wisdom through experience, not just study...
So the Inquisitorius views us as competition?
So the Order sent Jedi to secure the compasses.
So the Republic built a facility here to do what, exactly?
So the droid is a fish?
So the other B1s don't feel bad.
So the plan was to ambush us.
So the prospectors move out, and the beasts move in.
So the same as every other day...
So there I was:
So there we were! Four Quarren, armed with spears, each wi' a mind tae make a mantelpiece out o' ma wee rubbery head!
So there's more places like these on Jedha?
So these ruins do sing.
So they told me. Said he could grow back his arms, just like that!
So they were studying the growths here.
So this is Tanalorr.
So this is how we build an empire.
So this is my lot in life...
So this is the same tech that powers the compass?
So this is the work of Santari Khri.
So this is what befell my masters.
So this is where they've been hiding.
So this whole running around the galaxy, beating down bullies thing you've got going on?
So tiresome
So to Koboh did I go. An' since, I've realized why I like tae fish.
So to speak.
So turns out this moon wasn't haunted after all.
So unfair!
So violent!
So was I right, or was I right?
So we ask, what do they have in common?
So we can bag the Jedi!
So we can forgive it for leaving us to die.
So we have two masters?
So we rescue Zee, get out of here, find Tanalorr, and then...
So we start up some arrays, whatever those are. Punch a hole in the Abyss, and fly through?
So we thought.
So we'll be home early. Nice.
So we'll wait here, and see who's loudest.
So weak.
So what I'm saying is, stay calm and just try not to give 'em a reason to blast you.
So what are you doing out here?
So what brought you two to Koboh?
So what did you do before you came here?
So what did you find?
So what do you think?
So what do you want?
So what happened to your smuggling operation?
So what happened?
So what made you decide to leave?
So what were you doing in the forest before?
So what's the plan once we get that compass?
So what's the plan?
So what's the plan?
So what's the play here: you attack the Jedi, while I stay back, provide ranged support?
So what, they've rigged this whole place against us?
So where do we go from here?
So where to now?
So where we headed first? Back to Koboh, or its moon?
So who're we looking for exactly?
So why don't you go down the rope?
So why'd you choose to study the High Republic?
So will you.
So ye wish tae prick up yer ears an' receive the tale of Skoova?
So you are a Jedi.
So you can be pleasant - when there's profit to be made.
So you can move.
So you closed your eyes for "one second" and then this thing waltzed in and decided to join you for a little nap?
So you coming with us?
So you did.
So you discovered your talent early.
So you don't need money, or anything, huh?
So you finally made it, Cal.
So you have been deeper into the caves, then?
So you have improved.
So you in or what?
So you know something about this prospecting legend?
So you know what that makes us?
So you must feel like a commando droid!
So you really do not know much about the collapse of the Republic installations out here?
So you're a Jedi, huh?
So you're a Jedi.
So you're a commando droid, huh? Don't see many of you about.
So you're a specialist with the droids, right? Can you make 'em, you know, smarter?
So you're a tactical unit, is that right? Don't get to meet too many 'smart' droids.
So you're learning.
So you're not chilly?
So you're saying one might still be out there?
So you've been around a grip, right? What do you fancy our odds against a Jedi?
So you've been out of the game completely since the Empire cracked down?
So you've heard. They call a droid a cannibal when she integrates the finest components of her enemies.
So, Cordova thinks we'll find out how to cross the Abyss by tracking down Dagan's old haunts?
So, Cordova thinks we'll find out how to cross the Abyss by tracking down Dagan's old haunts?
So, I drop my spear, grab one of the beast's tentacles, and coil it around its throat until it was over.
So, I figure I make some noise, draw them away, you slip by.
So, I heard you fought the Empire on Kashyyyk.
So, I know some of these raiders want to kill this Jedi for daring to defy Rayvis, but you? You seem different.
So, I suppose it isn't true that Greez once flew the Mantis into the heart of a Haxion Brood asteroid base -
So, I understand you've been trying to fight the Empire on your own?
So, I'm like your bodyguard?
So, Merrin decided to come after all.
So, Monk, I've been thinking.
So, Rayvis programs these droids, and I maintain 'em, for what? To crush Jedi and rule a backwater?
So, Zyggy...
So, a cantina, huh? Didn't see that coming.
So, about what happened on the mesa.
So, after years of searching fer the great whale,
So, bartender, where's this oil bath you mentioned?
So, commando droids, right? What exactly does a commando droid do?
So, getting a soft 'yes' on rancor petting zoo. Okay, we'll table that for now.
So, guess the bridge isn't an option.
So, how are you adjusting to your new life?
So, how did you get this assignment?
So, how do I look?
So, how is Greez?
So, how is it?
So, how long have you been working for Cere?
So, how was the desert?
So, how was your time in the desert?
So, how'd everything turn out?
So, how'd it go?
So, how'd you learn metalwork?
So, it looks like we aren't the only ones who found romance on Koboh.
So, it's a recording? When do I start talking?
So, just more of the same.
So, lemme get this straight. No rancor, no survivors, no competition?
So, lemme get this straight. No rancor, no survivors, no competition?
So, level with me. What do you think our odds are? You know, 'gainst a real livin' Jedi.
So, looks like the place isn't destroyed.
So, next let's go to...
So, nice weather today, huh?
So, no. And please stop asking.
So, not like you.
So, rousin' ma final gasp of air, I sounded their shrill cry!
So, the coolant levels are fine, and the stabilizers are aligned.
So, there's some tar, and some trees.
So, they believe something is behind the Abyss?
So, this is how everything is still operational.
So, this is it. Tanalorr. You and Merrin be careful out there, okay?
So, uh, nothing went wrong while I was gone? No questions, concerns?
So, uh, think you could put in a word for me if I bag this Jedi?
So, was your trip to the forest worth the risk?
So, we gonna talk about this?
So, well, you know, actually, I think my schedule is just jammed.
So, what do you think happened to this squad?
So, what do you think of Jedha so far?
So, what do you think?
So, what drew you to Koboh?
So, what kind of adventures did you and Cal have before I crashed the party?
So, what was it like up there on the moon? I heard the Raiders moved in, but they're not very chatty.
So, what will you do now?
So, what'd ya find?
So, what'd you think?
So, where are we going?
So, where'd you find him?
So, where's that room at again?
So, where's the handoff?
So, who's interested in taking a trip to CoCo town? 
So, who's this 'Cere' we're going to see?
So, why'd ya leave Coruscant?
So, ye wish to hear of ma time on the Grapnel, with the crew of the dread captain Wan'yek Whett?
So, you and Greez have any big dreams for this cantina?
So, you didn't feel like helping me out there?
So, you ended up on Kuat? Shipyards must've had some interesting sounds.
So, you give that old tech Cal found in Dagan's place a look?
So, you got the compass, yeah? Well, guess that's it. Next stop, Jedha, and then, you know.
So, you have learned!
So, you have some ability.
So, you must be a Jedi.
So, you said you came here after a heist, huh?
So, you survived Rayvis.
So, you think you can take on ol' Greez?
So, you're a Jedi huh?
So, you're a Jedi.
So, you're a fortune teller?
So, you're from Coruscant, huh?
So, you're not joining us.
So, you're really one of them? A Jedi?
So, you've truly lived on Koboh your entire life?
So. Merrin, Nightsister of Dathomir.
So. This is the guy you told me about.
So... this is where you've been, Greez?
So...I'm okay?
So...no dispensation, then?
So...that's a 'no'?
So...uh, how...old are you?
So...you know she didn't just join to find Tanalorr, right?
So? We headed to Jedha or what?
So? What can you do with it?
Sojourner, you smell of smoke and sand.
Sojourner.
Sojourner.
Sojourner.
Sojourner. Tulakt would speak with you.
Sold some sensor jamming tech to a customer desperate to get a syndicate off his back.

Some of these rock columns are loose.
Some organics also fought with distinction.
Some other time, okay?
Some prospectors invited me to join them on an expedition.
Some prospectors told me about a strange building. Distinctive entrance, so they say.
Some regard us as free spirits, others as agitators.
Some roads are so winding that guesswork and a shred of luck are all one really has to go on.
Some say that if you listen closely, the voice of the winds will guide you along the trail.
Some says we oughta do as they says, and hide the exports.

Some striking variants here.
Some vow indeed.
Some what?
Somebody shoot him!
Someday when your children see this,
Somehow the Jedi of the High Republic found a way to navigate the Abyss and built a temple on Tanalorr.
Somehow, I don't think that'll satisfy Harr.

Something catch your eye?
Something charming about that old gal, wouldn't you say?
Something doesn't feel right.
Something else to check out?
Something going on?
Something happened here...
Something has the Raiders on-edge.
Something hit the moon a long time ago. The people left everything behind and fled.
Something in my sights.

Something in the wind ain't right.

Something is nearby.
Something isn't right, I'll check it out.

Something like that. What's next for you?
Something making noise?
Something might be here.
Something moves. 
Something moving over there. 
Something off, Greez?
Something on your mind?

Something...happened...
Sometimes I just wanna watch it all burn down, ya know?
Sometimes I see figures on the horizon.
Sometimes I think about who I would have become had we not met. What a strange galaxy we live in.
Sometimes it feels like history just repeats itself.
Sometimes the solution to a problem lies in how it's framed.
Sometimes the solution to a problem lies in how it's framed.
Sometimes the solution to a problem lies in how it's framed.
Sometimes you know just what to say.
Sometimes, I wonder if destroying the holocron had any impact.
Sometimes, I wonder why I bother. Anyone with real credits to spend leaves Koboh in a hurry.
Sometimes, everything out in the desert starts to look the same.
Sometimes, ye have tae strike first, no?
Sometimes. Alone.
Sometimes. It's like a dream.
Somewhere quiet and peaceful. Like it used to be.
Son of a...mogu!
Son you don't have to do this.
Son.
Soon after, Salpu's walking home, a sack full of priorite, a smile ear-to-ear, and bam!
Soon you will see what a real fight looks like.
Soon, they will join the brood.
Soon, you will sing again.
Sooner or later, a charged hydron-emulsion solution will find its way back to equilibrium. 
Sooner we're out of here the better.
Soooo, how about some fightin' tips? I am ready and willing to learn.
Sorc Tormo must really hate this guy. Hasn't sicced Kili Oso on anyone in years.
Sorc Tormo's never doubled a bounty before. You've got him twisted right up.
Sorc and his gang could use some more wholesome hobbies.
Sorc reached out with a job offer not long after. Ya gotta have a little streak of crazy to stay in this game.
Sorc says hello.
Sorc stepped up his game with this one. I'm flattered.
Sorc thinks this mark is worth calling the boss in?
Sorc was right, you Jedi are gullible!
Sorc's gonna be pleased.
Sorc's sent his very own arena champion, Jo the Cannibal, to the Lucrehulk with a gang of nasties as backup.
Sorc's thrown not just one, but two full Haxion gangs after you. 'Grats, Cal - you're now a bonafide bounty hunter.
Sorcery!
Sorcery!
Sorry Cal, but I'm busy tending to heritage here. That reminds me, I should check on that oil bath soon!
Sorry Cal, not now.
Sorry Gabs, not mine to give.
Sorry I asked.
Sorry to disturb you guys.
Sorry to hear that.
Sorry to keep you waiting, had to swat a few Bedlam flies to make a landing.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, BD. I warned him.
Sorry, Cal, I just want to be alone right now, okay?
Sorry, Cal, you don't have the pucks.
Sorry, Cal.
Sorry, Cal. Family comes first.
Sorry, Cal. Grock's in a mood.
Sorry, Cal. Lots of thirsty customers.
Sorry, I can't lower the price.
Sorry, I didn't mean to... Yes. I agree. Our position is honorable. Thank you, sir.
Sorry, I thought...
Sorry, I was just lost in thought.
Sorry, I was thinking of...something else. What did you say?
Sorry, I'm bein' ornery. Just not feeling like myself lately.
Sorry, Turgle, no time. We're heading out for a while.
Sorry, Wini.
Sorry, big wheel. We're not exactly flush with credits, and I don't think Rayvis is on the take.
Sorry, busy.
Sorry, coming.
Sorry, gotta go!
Sorry, hold that thought.
Sorry, kid! With the dust storm brewing, this is as close as I could get!
Sorry, never mind. What I'm trying to say that I'm here to talk. If you need me.
Sorry, old man. Ain't my day to die. You rest, I'll bury ya later.
Sorry, rambling. Bad habit. I'm Toa, by the way.
Sorry, scrapper.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry. I didn't get much sleep last night. 
Sorry. I know you two were close.
Sorry. When you play with me, the game is rigged from the start.
Sorry...I was...somewhere else.

Spare a moment, boy?
Spare me! It's about survivin'. That's enough!
Spare me.

Stick around too long, and it changes you. Take Turgle, for instance.
Stick close, buddy.
Stick to the saber!
Stick to your patrol parameters, droid.
Stick with the plan, we'll be fine.
Sticking with the saber, eh? Big mistake.
Still annoying.
Still at it, huh?
Still at your research?
Still can't believe it.
Still don't trust you.
Still figuring that out.
Still figuring that out. You think Greez's 'Latero Souffle' would survive a hyperspace jaunt?
Still getting into trouble, Turgle?
Still got a lot of work ahead of us.
Still got it!
Still got it.
Still green, hm?
Still here! Awaiting much-needed assistance!

Still standing, eh?
Still standing, eh?
Still standing, hm?
Still standing?
Still stuck, huh?
Still taking you down. 
Still talking in your sleep, huh?
Still thinking it through.
Still time for that, but he'd better get a move on, or the Empire will beat him to it!
Still weird.
Still with me, BD?
Still working on it.
Still working on it.
Still, I regret ever walkin' away from the Mantis. Keep thinking I'm gonna slip up.
Still, I'm impressed. Without a leader, they're gonna lose a lot of 'oomph'.
Still, I'm liable to miss the next score - or a blaster muzzle in my face - if I stand here whinin'.
Still, we weren't beaten.
Still. Can't be too careful.
Still. Could probably find space for a few more plants...
Still... [spits]

Storm's getting closer.
Storm's getting closer. Shouldn't we find some shelter?
Stormtrooper gear appears substandard.
Stormtrooper patrol.
Stormtrooper! Get a hold of yourself. I heard nothing - you heard nothing. Stay in position and be ready.
Stormtrooper, do you know your orders?
Stormtrooper, you seem anxious.
Stormtrooper. Schedule for returning to basecamp?
Stormtroopers don't understand the thrill of the hunt.
Stormtroopers found it.
Stormtroopers play their part, but I do not envy their inferior tasks.

Structural readouts indicate that we are perfectly secure, sir.
Stubborn! And...well, mostly stubborn. We're like moss, we are. Scrape us off, we just grow right back!
Stubborn. But I've taken down worse.
Stuck in this junk hole of a cantina. Better than being dead, I guess.
Stuck out here, waitin' for some weirdo with a lightsaber, with the least social droid on the planet for company.
Stuck ship? Tell me about it.
Stuck the landing.
Stuff that's new is exciting, sure. But what really counts is consistency. Reliability.

That blade is a Jedi weapon.
That blaster is not set to stun!
That borders on insubordination.
That bramlik is going down.
That bug has my name on it.
That bug took my opening!
That bug's in bits.

That can happen to you next.

That can't be good.
That can't be good.
That can't be possible.
That can't be right...
That can't be up to code, even out here on the frontier.
That can't be!
That can't be!
That cannot save you.
That cannot stop me.
That cannot stop me.
That chain of kindness kept the Republic going...for a while.
That charge is both fast and strong.

That could be you, be careful.
That could happen to you.
That could leave a mark.
That creature ain't gonna last long now.
That creature has been destroyed.
That critter never stood a chance.
That damn Imperial ship. Sometimes, I think I should've remained on Jedha.
That defies gravity.
That definitely broke something.
That definitely isn't a blaster.
That detonator is gone!
That detonator will not reach its target.
That did it, sounds like the Array is powering up.
That did nothing.
That did the trick!
That did the trick.
That did the trick. Let's move.
That didn't answer my question...
That didn't do it.
That didn't do it.
That didn't last long.
That didn't stop me.
That didn't work.
That didn't work. I wonder what happened here. 
That does not compute. Time has no meaning to me!
That does not fill me with confidence!
That does not sound appetizing.
That does the trick. 
That doesn't bode well.
That doesn't change our orders!
That doesn't look good.
That doesn't look good.
That doesn't matter. It's our duty!
That doesn't mean anything.
That doesn't scare me!
That doesn't scare me.
That doesn't scare me.
That doesn't scare me.
That doesn't seem like it's my duty at all.
That doesn't seem possible!
That doesn't sound good!
That doesn't sound good.
That doesn't sound like a very peaceful method to me.
That doesn't sound very becoming of a Jedi.
That doesn't sound very fun.
That doesn't worry me.
That don't impress me.
That door wouldn't last against a roller mine.
That drill will take time to set up.
That drill's going to be a problem.

That gadget we found in the Stone Spires - think it can help here?
That garden of Pili's is really comin' together.
That giant piasa you sweet talked reminds me of a time when I was out on a mountain hike with my older brother.
That gorger's a goner
That gorocco is intense!
That gorocco's got quite the kick!
That great ship came descendin' on us like an anchor cuttin' the deep.
That grenade is going, going, gone!
That grenade is gone.
That grenade wasn't important!
That gunship's heading towards the rendezvous.
That guy really didn't like you.
That had to hurt.
That hardshell is out of action.
That hardshell isn't getting back up
That he did.
That her name? She's definitely not your typical droid.
That hit the spot.
That hurt!
That hurt?
That hurt?
That hurt?
That hurt? 
That intel better be worth it, Cal.
That is a Gen'Dai. They do not often ally with other species.
That is a Jedi ability.
That is a Jedi weapon.
That is a Jedi.
That is a Jedi.
That is a Jedi.
That is a groundshaking slam.
That is a laser sword.
That is a lot of tar.
That is a nasty, nasty swipe!
That is a poor excuse.
That is acceptable. Carry on.
That is actually a powerful incentive.
That is affirmative.
That is all of them.
That is an acceptable military strategy.
That is an unfortunate development.
That is big, too big, much too big.
That is blasphemy!
That is correct.
That is effective.
That is extremely irrelevant.
That is how we will defeat the Empire. Time, time, time.
That is insufficient.
That is less relevant.
That is no way to show gratitude for our leader.
That is not a compliment.
That is not a significant loss.
That is not good.
That is not how numbers work.
That is not how this works.
That is not impressive.
That is not necessary.
That is not supposed to happen.
That is not the way to Cere's base.
That is nothing!
That is odd. Keep an eye out.
That is one angry little bird.
That is one big beast!
That is one big beast.
That is one big nasty!
That is one dead Skriton!
That is one definitively dead Jedi.
That is one severed torso.
That is one vicious kick from the gorocco.

That is very, very scary.
That is what I intend to find out...
That is what I wanted to see.
That is what you're upset about? What's wrong with you?
That is where we are going, but we must take the long way for now.
That is why I am superior.
That is why I could not tell you that I'd returned, my friend. My sincerest apologies.
That is why I do not charge you, sojourner.
That is why I have a very important task for you Zee.
That is why we are an optimal combat unit.
That is why we are here: to finish the job.
That is why we serve.
That is why we serve.
That is yours to decide.
That is yours to decide.
That is, before our gelatinous friend here arrived.
That is... a smell, alright.
That isn't easy to do.
That isn't fair!
That isn't going to stop me.
That isn't good.
That isn't how that works.
That isn't very comforting.
That isn't what I asked.
That it has, but keep it to yourself, will ya? I've got a cantina to run.
That it?
That it? Oh well.
That it? Oh well.
That jetpack's handy!
That job is ours.
That just about does it.
That just won't do!
That kid eats like a starving rancor. I gotta pick up some more scazz steaks before we head out.
That kind of a traitor doesn't care about borders, only destruction.
That kind of information still won't stop me!

That last enemy wasn't even a challenge.
That leg was important!
That life...it's so long ago. And so much has happened since then.
That lightsaber can cut through anything!
That lightsaber can dissect armor!
That lightsaber is dangerous.

That looks like a pretty hard shell.
That looks like trouble.
That looks promising.
That looks unhappy.
That looks weak.
That made my circuits ache.
That makes sense, but that's no way for me to live.
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
That makes this fight tricky.
That may be about to change.
That means more to me than you can imagine. What was your name again?
That means nothing to me.
That means you're a Jedi!
That means you've seen a Jedi!
That mogu is mad and ready to hurt someone.
That mogu looks angry!
That mogu looks like trouble.
That mogu lost an arm!
That moon...
That much is evident.
That must be another one of those High Republic Chambers.
That must be the Forest Array.
That must be the knowledge your master purged from your memory banks.
That must be the way out. But how do we get there?
That must hurt.
That must've been quite a day.
That must've been quite the throw. How'd you manage it?
That must've toughened you up.
That musta hurt.
That musta hurt.
That never gets old!
That never gets old.

That one can be nasty. Be careful.
That one doesn't count.
That one doesn't play nice, huh BD?
That one is dead.
That one is mine!
That one there!
That one was BD.
That one was all you, BD.
That one was for me.
That one!
That one's all yours, Bode.
That one's down!
That one's for me.
That one's held!
That one's tough.
That outcome is undesirable.
That pistol-packing Nautolan with the hat doesn't exactly scream 'relax'.
That place is a fortress.
That place isn't just an old ruin - it's a tomb.
That planet is a haven for those who stand against the Empire.
That power!
That power!
That power-!
That power?!
That power?!
That priorite's mine for the taking!
That purifier had it coming!
That rancor is a significant danger.
That rancor is deadly.
That remains to be seen.
That right?
That right?
That right?
That right?
That right?
That saber can cut through anything!
That saber cannot save you from the Empire.
That saber cuts through anything!
That saber won't save you, Jedi.
That saber won't save you.
That saber's mine!
That scum is no longer in my way
That seal looks familiar...
That search led me back to my old apprentice.
That section of wall looks weak...
That seems excessive.
That seems implausible.
That seems painful.
That seems to have done it.
That seems unfair!
That seems unlikely.
That seems unnecessary.
That seems...weird...
That sentry droid could be trouble.
That shell absorbs blaster fire!

That shell can't match a saber.
That shell gave me comfort, and now it's gone!
That shell is gone.
That shell looks pretty solid.
That shell stood no chance!
That shell was no good.
That shell will be worth a pretty penny.
That shield didn't do much.
That shield is supposed to stop anything!
That shield's too tough for our blasters!
That ship's in Bedlam Raider territory. That means it's mine.
That should do it for now.
That should do it.
That should give us some cover.
That shouldn't be a problem anymore, I already cleared them out.
That shouldn't be possible...
That shouldn't happen!
That shuttle crashed hard.
That slam shook my very bones!
That so surprising? I know a little about most things and I'm patient with kids.
That so?
That sometimes, it is best not to ask questions.
That sort of trip, I see.
That sounds a little demeaning.
That sounds like a goal I can get behind.
That sounds like a hard place to leave behind.
That sounds like a nightmare.
That sounds like a yes to me.
That sounds like every day, not that it's glorious.
That sounds like it could be dangerous! 
That sounds pretty good to me.
That sounds uncomfortable.
That sounds very inefficient. You need your heart for other things.
That sounds...incredible.
That stinkin' droid!
That stopped it.
That stormtrooper isn't getting up. 
That stupid bird was asking for it.
That super droid is finished.
That supposed to scare me?
That sword tells me all I need to know.
That takes guts.
That takes skill!
That tech I tried to sell to Rayvis, there's more of it in the valley. A building right in the center, ya can't miss it.
That tech I tried to sell to Rayvis, there's more of it in the valley. Building right in the center, ya can't miss it.
That the Empire regards our work as seditious is irrelevant.
That the Nightsister who used to run with you and Greez?
That they are.
That they're dangerous traitors to the Empire. That's all we need to know.
That thing deserved it.
That thing did a number on the Mantis.
That thing has a pilot?

That thing will rip us apart!
That thing's finished.
That thing's not so big.
That things not getting back up.
That time.
That unit is destroyed.

That was a big mistake. 
That was a big pool of contenders to carve through.
That was a clean cut.
That was a close call, but now it's even more dangerous.
That was a close one, buddy.
That was a physics joke.
That was a weak shield. 
That was almost too much to handle.
That was before Cere told me they're helping those poor refugees hide from the Empire.
That was before Cere told me they're helping those poor refugees hide from the Empire.
That was brutal.
That was clever.
That was close.
That was close.
That was close.
That was close.
That was cool.
That was easy.
That was fated for you.
That was for the Hidden Path.
That was fun, huh, BD?
That was fun. What's next?
That was inevitable.
That was it, the echo's gone.
That was its blaster arm!
That was just the warm up.
That was laughable.
That was laughable.
That was lazy.
That was luck!
That was luck.
That was merely a pawn!
That was my jetpack.
That was my kill!
That was nice, Greez.
That was no challenge, scum.
That was no ordinary Droideka.
That was nothing!

That was our last flametrooper! Stop him!
That was our last flametrooper.
That was our last flametrooper.
That was our last gunner!
That was our last gunner! Watch your back!
That was our last gunner.
That was our last gunner. Attempting to change tactics. 
That was our last gunner. Change formation. 
That was our last probe droid.
That was our last ranged trooper!
That was our last ranged trooper. Move up. 
That was our last rocket trooper!
That was our last rocket trooper. Trying to change position. 
That was our last rocket trooper...
That was our last rocket unit. 
That was our last rocket unit. 
That was our last rocket unit. Move up. 
That was our last rocket unit? We're in trouble.  
That was our last security droid!
That was out last gunner!
That was out last gunner. Keep steady. 
That was out last heavy gunner.
That was pretty impressive.
That was sloppy.
That was soooo easy.
That was supposed to be a compliment.
That was the Stinger Mantis, alright. Technically, it's Greez's ship.
That was the blade-swinging arm!
That was the last BX unit.
That was the last Droideka.
That was the last melee unit in this sector.

That was the last rocket unit!
That was the plan.
That was their attacking arm!
That was uncalled for!
That was unfortunate.
That was unnecessary.
That was unreal.
That was very dramatic.
That was violent.
That was your doing, wasn't it?
That was your job, trooper.
That was... almost enjoyable.
That was... pretty dramatic.
That was... way too close. 
That was... weird.
That was...brutal.
That was...incredible!
That was...really something, Skoova.
That wasn't good enough.
That wasn't it; the echo hasn't faded.
That wasn't me!
That wasn't me, I swear!
That wasn't part of its body?
That wasn't so hard.
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal. I've sent you the location of Cere Junda's hideout.
That wave coupler can clear the matter but something's blocking it.
That way is blocked.
That we gave him no choice. That he'd do anything to keep Kata safe.
That weak, eh?
That weapon looks dangerous.
That went too quickly. 
That will be repaid!
That will be your last.
That will do.
That will effect the B2's mobility.
That will have to do, I suppose.
That will not be tolerated.
That will not stop me.
That will not stop you!
That will slow them down.
That will sting.
That window leads back outside.
That won't cut it!
That won't deter me.
That won't distract him for long.
That won't do it.
That won't do it.
That won't get you far.
That won't get you far.
That won't grow back.
That won't help you with me.
That won't help.
That won't last forever!
That won't last you long.
That won't last you long.
That won't make a difference.
That won't save ya, Cal.
That won't save you!
That won't save you.
That won't save you.
That won't save you.
That won't stand! Uh, sorry.
That won't stop me.
That won't stop them.
That won't stop us!
That won't stop us.
That won't stop you from dying.
That won't work forever!
That won't work.
That worth a bonus?
That would be an understatement.
That would be my Great-Grandma Pyloon's Protato Namba patties.
That would be nice, huh? Getting away, leaving all this behind.
That would be perfectly fine.
That would be too easy.
That would be when the ceiling suffered a minor bout of structural fatigue -
That would explain it...
That would explain why it's been so quiet! Nice to see someone putting those raiders in their place.
That would naturally attract you.
That would never happen to me.
That wouldn't stop me.
That wretched Order will rue the day they betrayed me and forsook Tanalorr!
That ya buddy's piece?
That yacht should be swarming with troopers. What gives?
That yacht's a Sienar Ramsidian.
That you can resist.
That you did.
That you have to fight if things are gonna get better.
That you ought to be reading them. No more dithering.
That you would presume to know what drives me.
That your best shot?
That your best?
That your life meant nothing.
That your ship came down in Dredger Gorge?
That your ship outside?
That! Is enough!
That'd be nice, I can't stop just yet, though.
That'd be wonderful!
That'd help us stand out.
That'll cost ya.
That'll do it.
That'll do.
That'll give us the boost.
That'll heal.
That'll hurt!
That'll just make it angrier.
That'll make a fine trophy!
That'll put us all at ease, Cal. Zygg's one of the good ones.
That'll reduce our margins, and bringing in extra protection could paint a target on the saloon.
That'll teach 'em.
That's BD-1. I'm Cal.
That's Bode.
That's Caij Vanda. She's a bounty hunter. Or at least, she used to be. She's retired now.
That's Cere's hallikset. Wonder why it ended up here.
That's Cere, I sent word ahead that we'd be visiting. Lemme put it up on the holoprojector.
That's Harsh
That's Imperial equipment!
That's Rayvis' ship!
That's Rayvis' ship.
That's Zee with 'em.
That's a B2 down.
That's a Jedi alright...
That's a Jedi alright...
That's a Jedi blade.
That's a Jedi weapon!
That's a Jedi weapon.
That's a Jedi's weapon. 
That's a Jedi.
That's a Jedi. Oh boy.
That's a bad sign. Word has gotten out that I'm on planet.
That's a bet I'll take.
That's a big creature.
That's a big skeleton. Is there anything they don't eat?
That's a blasted Jedi!
That's a blow to morale.
That's a clean cut!
That's a clean slice!
That's a close call.
That's a cut-up critter.
That's a dead bird.
That's a destroyed droideka.
That's a fine piece of gear.
That's a first.
That's a fun trinket.
That's a good bogling.
That's a good idea. You're probably not as alone as you think.
That's a good point! I'll keep it to myself, promise!
That's a good spamel.
That's a good trick!
That's a good, clean kill.
That's a heartbreaker for Cal Kestis!
That's a heavy unit down...
That's a hit!
That's a hit!
That's a juicy rancor stomp.
That's a kill.
That's a kill.
That's a laser sword.
That's a lightsaber!
That's a lightsaber!
That's a lightsaber.
That's a lightsaber.
That's a long list.
That's a long trip. Couldn't have been easy.
That's a lot of damage.
That's a lot of firepower.
That's a lot of gear. These folks really went all-in on their expedition.
That's a mean gorger.
That's a nasty swing!
That's a new one. Didn't think you went for friendly hellos.
That's a new species. Better hear what Pili has to say about it.
That's a nice move.
That's a nice one.
That's a nice toy.
That's a nice toy.
That's a pain to fix.
That's a pretty clean cut.
That's a really dead bird.
That's a reinforced durasteel chassis!
That's a rock.
That's a score for Cal!
That's a scratch!
That's a shame, he wasn't so bad.
That's a skill senators prize, right? Cooperation?
That's a small blaster.
That's a solid hit.
That's a springy bug!
That's a start.
That's a stim!
That's a stim!
That's a stormtrooper down. 
That's a stormtrooper down...
That's a tactical disadvantage.
That's a tight shave.
That's a tough shell.
That's a twisted sense of humor you've got...but I like it!
That's a useful droid, huh?
That's a very good nekko.
That's actually good fatherly advice.
That's all I care about. Only crikkin' reason I'm out here hoofing it with you metalheads.
That's all done.
That's all it took?
That's all of the rocket troopers.
That's all of their flame troopers.
That's all of their rocket troopers.
That's all of them.
That's all there is to say.
That's alright by me.
That's amateur.
That's amazing!
That's amazing! Did you win?
That's an ally down.
That's an arm gone!
That's an interestin' worldview you got there.
That's an interesting turn.
That's an unfortunate end.
That's an unusual power.
That's another ally down!
That's another down!
That's another thing I like about you, Cal. Smart enough to know trouble when you see it.
That's another!
That's awful. But you don't blame yourself for leading them there?
That's bad. Oh, that's bad.
That's because I have been saving up for this one.
That's because I polish it all the time!
That's because there's nothing here, you dolt.
That's because troops like you are getting distracted. Focus.
That's because you broke that roof. Meanwhile, I once took out a shiverpede with my bare hands.
That's beside the point!
That's beside the point. I allowed my wounded pride to cloud my judgement.
That's brutal. I like it.
That's certainly one way to use your head!
That's classified.
That's close enough.
That's close enough.
That's close enough.
That's close enough.
That's cold.
That's condensation. You're breathing too hard.
That's cruel!
That's cute.
That's cute.
That's different.
That's easy for you to say, with the fancy armor.
That's enough running. 
That's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough!
That's enough! Back to your post.
That's enough! On the ground. 
That's enough, Jedi!
That's enough.
That's enough.
That's enough. Get back on the comms.
That's enough. Jedi.
That's enough. Let's get back to it.
That's exactly the problem with newcomers, ya don't think.
That's fancy. 
That's far enough!
That's far enough!
That's far enough!
That's far enough!
That's fascinating! Oh, and dangerous, right.
That's fast!
That's fear, right there.
That's from Lizz. To psych herself up for a mission, she'd bounce on the couch as hard as she could.
That's funny, that's the exact same thing you said the day we all split up.
That's generous. Out here, they'd probably scrap you for parts. How'd you repay them?
That's going to get in the way.
That's gonna leave a mark. 
That's gonna take a lot of work.
That's good enough for me.
That's good!
That's good, friend.
That's good, girl.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good.
That's good. Deep breath, Turgle.
That's good. I wouldn't want to serve anyone else!
That's good. We need more droids like you.
That's great, Cere.
That's great, I think! I should really learn binary.
That's great, boy.
That's great, c'mon.
That's handled.
That's hardly fair! You haven't got a nose.
That's highly illogical.
That's him! The Jedi!
That's horrible, Skoova.
That's horrible.
That's how I like it.
That's how it gets you, Kata. It's all glittering lights and fancy noise, but under all that? Don't get me started.
That's how it is. You play the cards you have.
That's how it looks alright.
That's how it works with me.
That's how it's done.
That's how it's done. 
That's how they tell it.
That's how we honor the fallen.
That's how we take him out. 
That's how you do it. 
That's how you kill a rawka.
That's how you prepare for death. Rest when you're dead, stormtrooper.
That's impossible.
That's impossible.
That's impossible. The abyss destroys everything that goes near it.
That's inhuman...
That's insubordination! But maybe you're right...
That's it for him.
That's it for our droid...
That's it for our flametrooper support!
That's it for our flametroopers. 
That's it for our gunner support.
That's it for our heavy artillery support.
That's it for our ranged troopers.
That's it for our rocket troopers.
That's it for the B2s.

That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it! No more melee units!
That's it! We're out of droids!
That's it, I'm swearing off jetpacks.
That's it, blast 'em.
That's it, girl.
That's it, girl.
That's it, give it a try. Not bad, huh?
That's it, got no more ranged trooper backup!
That's it, nearly at the end!
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it. Bleed out.
That's it. He's down. 
That's it. Stay focused!
That's it. We're out of Probe droids.
That's it. We're out of Viper droids.
That's it. We're out of droids. 
That's it... it's all over now.
That's it? Fine.
That's just a rumor.
That's just being organic, metal man.
That's kind of you. Thanks!
That's less than half.
That's life on the frontier.
That's me.
That's me.
That's mighty brazen, even for them!
That's mighty weird, son.
That's mine when you're dead.
That's mine!
That's mine.
That's more like it.
That's more than you can say for any other establishment on this rock.
That's my line. Know your role. You shoot things, I'm the pilot.
That's nice of ya, kid, but you should play.
That's nice to hear.
That's nice.
That's no easy fix, but we won't be flying again without replacing it.
That's no good!
That's not a pleasant smell.
That's not alloooOOOWED!
That's not as comforting as I had hoped it would be.
That's not as comforting to me as you think.
That's not confirmed, watch your tongue!
That's not doing anything.
That's not exactly what I wanna hear from my escort, pal.
That's not fair to the poor droid!
That's not fair!
That's not flying anymore.
That's not good for the droid, you know!
That's not good news.
That's not good, right?
That's not good.
That's not good.
That's not great.
That's not how I play. [breathing]
That's not moving.
That's not moving.
That's not normal. 
That's not opening.
That's not possible!
That's not possible!
That's not possible...
That's not proper blaster handling procedure. 
That's not right!
That's not so scary.
That's not something you see often.
That's not very nice! But actually my sensors may be malfunctioning.
That's not very reassuring.
That's not what walls are for.
That's not what walls are for.
That's not working.
That's not yours!
That's not...
That's nothin' for the battle-hardened!
That's nothin'!
That's nothin'!
That's nothin'!
That's nothin'.
That's nothin'.
That's nothing special.
That's nothing!
That's nothing.
That's nothing.
That's nothing. 
That's nothing. 
That's nothing. 
That's okay, I'm not so hungry.
That's one big beast!
That's one bisected beast.
That's one dead bug.
That's one dead droid.
That's one done bird.
That's one down.
That's one down...
That's one good deed, Jedi.
That's one hefty heaving stomp!
That's one less shiverpede.
That's one less tail to worry about.
That's one less to worry about.
That's one of my favorites.
That's one problem solved.
That's one way not to get mud on your boots, huh?
That's one way to deal with that.
That's one way to disarm.
That's one way to do it.
That's one way to do it.
That's one way to end it. 
That's only for the feeble-minded.
That's our Probe Droid support down.
That's our Viper Droid support gone.

That's our last heavy gunner!
That's our last ranged trooper.
That's our last ranged trooper.
That's our last ranged trooper. 
That's our last rocket trooper.
That's our last rocket trooper. 
That's our last rocket trooper...
That's our last suppression unit. 
That's over a thousand credits, all for one job!
That's over.
That's pathetic.
That's precious.
That's pretty courageous. Raider turf isn't exactly ideal for research.
That's pretty formidable.
That's pretty grizzly.
That's probably not good.
That's quite an arsenal you've got there.
That's quite the carapace.
That's quite the story, Zee.
That's ridiculous.
That's right!
That's right!
That's right! And you have just helped us gather beastly data for our game!
That's right! I was once the most infamous outlaw in the Outer Rim.
That's right! I'm a Koboh local and proud of it! This is my home, and I'm gonna defend it!
That's right! Run!
That's right! The outpost is under our watchful eyes!
That's right, and me on account of bein' the smoothest thing since Hutt blubber.
That's right, and you?
That's right, boy.
That's right, but you annoy me a lot less than the others in this go-nowhere town. And I think you feel the same!
That's right, kiddo. I'm gonna teach you to cook. I could use an assistant, and the others, well...
That's right, little droid. Could be the makings of a tragedy. Most things on Koboh are.
That's right, man. Deedee's been all over these glider calls!
That's right, run!
That's right, you have the mind of a true botanist.
That's right, you're a local. So, what'd it used to be?
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right. A planet.
That's right. An impossible catch! No fisher in their right mind would pursue such a quarrelsome foe...
That's right. Awhile back, this one prospector got into an argument with his protocol droid.
That's right. Heard there was fortune to be had s'long as you ain't a lazybones, and I jolly well ain't!
That's right. I am an artist, not a propagandist.
That's right. I used to hang out at this monitoring station just listening to the yards.
That's right. I was tending bar for a sabacc game that Greez frequented.
That's right. I'm not done with you yet, Zygg. Not by a long shot!
That's right. In a pack, each hunter has their own role. Safer, too.
That's right. She took me in, showed me around, hid me - 'cause I was on the run, Cal.
That's right. Shop's built on trust and quality, and I aim to keep it that way.
That's right. There's all sorts of mean critters on Koboh -
That's right. They have to blasted, and I'm gonna be the one to do it!
That's right. We get back into the gorge, kickstart those dams, maybe we finally make some real scratch.
That's right. We have reports of movement on the moon, and from their base.
That's right. What are you waiting for? It's just up the stairs! Go check it out! 
That's right. What's there but to follow someone like that, eh?
That's right. When I first arrived on Coruscant, he was kind enough to show me around.
That's right. You ever been there?
That's right. You know anything about this laboratory on the moon, Greez?
That's right. You stick with Greez. He's one of the good ones. Just don't tell him I said that.
That's right. You'll be swapping holodiscs with Zee in no time.
That's scrap now.
That's so much better.
That's some name.
That's some vow.
That's someone over there, right?
That's something I didn't need to know.
That's strange. 
That's surely worth buying me a drink to celebrate?
That's that, then.
That's that. You good, BD?
That's the B1s down.
That's the Force!
That's the Jedi!
That's the best droid we had!
That's the challenge I'm hoping for. It makes the reward sweeter. 
That's the end of our ranged support!
That's the end of that droideka.
That's the end of that.
That's the end of them.
That's the gate Zee told us about.
That's the good news.
That's the last KX unit.
That's the last Viper in our sector.
That's the last droid in our sector. 
That's the last gunner.
That's the last of our artillery!
That's the last of our droids!

That's the last of them.
That's the last of them.
That's the last of those flame troopers!
That's the last of those wretched machines!
That's the last probe in our sector.
That's the last rocket trooper...
That's the last thing I want.
That's the last thing I want.
That's the match to Cal!
That's the money.
That's the one! Always knew they weren't Koboh material.
That's the one.
That's the plan.
That's the plan.
That's the point of the arm! Go on, take a look!
That's the right answer! You're fun, too!
That's the round to Cal Kestis!
That's the spirit!
That's the spirit, BD. We'll get it.
That's the spot.
That's the stable master, huh? I thought I smelled nekko dung around here...
That's the story I keep telling myself, sport. That's the story...
That's the stuff!
That's the stuff.
That's the thing, I'm not. It was luck. Never played sabacc again.
That's the way back.
That's the way back.
That's the way through.
That's their mandate.
That's too bad.
That's too bad.
That's too close!
That's too high.
That's true. For a very long time.
That's true. I guess we'll have to settle for command positions. 
That's uncalled for.
That's unexpected.
That's unstoppable!
That's very bold for a droid! I can't wait to find out if you're right.
That's very poetic.
That's war, soldier.
That's what I like to hear.
That's what I like to hear.
That's what I like to hear. Lay it on me.
That's what I like to hear. Take down a heavy hitter like Kili Oso and you'll be making a statement.
That's what I want to hear.
That's what I'm paying you for!
That's what I'm talking about!
That's what Jedi do!
That's what happens when you get too close.
That's what he gets for not following patrol procedures. 
That's what it means to be hunted.
That's what keeping me going.
That's what the Empire is all about. Taming the galaxy. Bringing it to order.
That's what they all say at first. Just give it time.
That's what they do best.
That's what they get.
That's what they tell me.
That's what worries me.
That's what you get when you stick your neck out.
That's what you think. That's what you hope.
That's what your enemies do, ain't it? Turn your strengths into liabilities.
That's when they get you. Keep your eyes open.
That's why the Mantis always gets colder at full speed.
That's why they built that array in the forest.
That's why this place already looks like a war zone. Glad it's on our side.
That's why we keep fighting.
That's why you don't mess with goroccos!
That's why you're my favorite. But don't tell Bravo, he plays it cool, but he's a softy on the inside.
That's wonderful. I can teach you all sorts of - 
That's your problem, not mine.
That's... exactly what I'm gonna do.
That's... that's not possible.
That's...acceptable.
That's...funny...
That's...not possible.
That's...not pretty.
That's...not right?
That's...that's a Jedi!
That, Cal, is why I'm here instead of rotting in a Muunilinst work camp.
That, or someone with a lightsaber's slicing through our ranks.
That, you're wrong on, bud.
That. That's Dagan's orders.
That...
That... was me. 
That...did not look good.
That...doesn't seem fair.
That...stupid loyal Jedi jerk.
That...wasn't fair.
That...wasn't me...right?

The Empire's there too.
The Empire, of course.
The Empire, the Haxion Brood, half the galaxy wants us dead.

The bearded Besalisk barked that he intended tae fish in our waters.
The beast dies.
The beast here gets spooked when something's wrong. Don't know what it is, but I've learned to trust 'em.
The beast is dead.
The beast is mine.
The beast is slain.
The beast lived.
The beast will pierce you.
The beast's arm has been severed.
The beasts have ever let me be. And the Empire have their own concerns. I'm staying right here.
The beautiful thing about droids: you can erase their memory.
The bedrocks of the Empire are prosperity and security. All citizens must do their part.
The best thing about Tanalorr is the quiet. It's about as far from the Empire as you can imagine.
The best trooper is a smart trooper.
The best.
The better strategy wins, always.
The better the drinks, the happier the clientele. Which means, of course, the more they talk.
The big score. The one we've been waitin' for - sittin' right under the Imps' noses.
The bigger mystery: why she decided to wear that hat in public!
The bilemaw attacks headfirst!
The bilemaw does not play around!
The bilemaw wants to go head-to-head.
The bird from the Forest Array...
The blade decided. It chose me.
The blade decides!
The bounty's down there. 
The bounty. Above. 
The bridge to Pilgrim's Sanctuary.
The bright colors are to intimidate predators. Truly, the plant is harmless, and quite pretty.
The bumpers are stopping the panels. Might be a way to lift them.
The campus looks like it's floating over the ground. It's magical.
The cantina reminds you of people dancing?
The capital of the Empire. I have never been there.
The captain's harpoon skewered 'em like a quellfish on a spit.
The caverns are deep and dangerous, Jedi. There is more you do not know.
The chambers are unique. Each one hones a different facet.
The champion is back for more.
The charge is set, get back!
The choice can be...overwhelming.
The claws on that beast, just look at them!
The climate is dusty, it will affect my mobility.
The commander's gone. The ship's coming apart!
The commando droid!
The commando droids! C'mon!
The compass is gonna be good as new.
The compromises I made created a future for my people.
The control tower.
The core.
The coward has fled.
The coward's here somewhere.
The creature inspects BD-1, who has begun scanning it.
The creature is dead.
The creature is exposed now.
The creature is gone, but it will return.
The creature lies slain.
The creature still stands.
The creature, although skittish, allows BD-1's intrusion, whilst Cal remains cautious.
The curfew is still in effect. Remain indoors and do not interfere with the ongoing special security operation.
The dangers of the Jedi are highly exaggerated.
The date of an organic's birth is arbitrary and meaningless.
The demise of your Order allowed me to escape.
The destroyer! How did you-!?
The diner I told you about! Maybe it's time we checked the place out.
The dirt and bugs and mold and trash?
The dock...where's the senator?
The doers do, and the sayers squawk about it.
The dread captain Wan'yek Whett took notice. He showered me in brevets, gave me the best o' catches -
The dread captain peeled his whiskers from his teeth and grinned a most ghastly grin -
The drink is one part brinebrew, two parts oratay, and topped off with bitters.
The droid falls so that we may stand.
The droid falls!
The droid has a stim canister!
The droid has been disarmed.
The droid has lost an arm
The droid has one less arm.
The droid is aiding him!
The droid is in pieces!
The droid is mine!
The droid is no more.
The droid will arrive momentarily. Stand by.
The droid will be fine. He is as resilient as Cal, in his own way.
The droideka - no!
The droideka has ceased functioning.
The droids are a useful tool in our fight.
The droids are down.
The droids arm has been removed
The droids arm was cut off.
The droids belong to Rayvis, not you.
The droids from the Forest Array?
The droids lack belief. They can never prevail. But we can.
The eastern wing of the temple.
The echo hasn't faded. I guess that didn't work.
The echo's fading... I wonder what happened?
The echo's lingering.
The echo's still here. 
The echo's still here. I don't think that did it.
The eels swarmed in an electric blaze! The dread crew scattered, an' Wan'yek -
The end is coming, Jedi.
The enemy approaches. 
The enemy has a laser sword.
The enemy has a laser sword. 
The enemy has destroyed the vipers.
The enemy has escaped. 
The enemy has evaded again. 
The enemy has fled!
The enemy has gone below.
The enemy has hope. I'll drain it from him.
The enemy has stims.
The enemy is a Jedi!
The enemy is above us!
The enemy is beneath us. 
The enemy is dangerous.
The enemy is firing.
The enemy is here. 
The enemy is hurt. 
The enemy is injured.
The enemy is intimidating.
The enemy is severely hurt. 
The enemy is severely injured!
The enemy is still near.
The enemy is up there.
The enemy is up there. 
The enemy is very dangerous.
The enemy is violent.
The enemy is wounded.
The enemy of the Empire!
The enemy will try to intimidate you with wild moves.
The enemy! He's above!
The enemy's down there. 
The enemy's going down. I've got a plan.
The escape pods are this way.
The exit is this way!
The fabled Faa fish. Its tale is one riven with greed - soaked to the bone with tragedy.
The failed coup on Norsid.
The faster they move, the stronger the challenge. I accept.
The fate of the Jedi Order lies in your hands.
The fauna around here sure are riled up.
The fence had failed to update our transponder codes and our vessel was marked.
The fight continues.
The fight is over here.
The fight was never your goal.
The fire support is out.
The fire will neutralize the threat.
The first target we see is all mine.
The first time I held her...
The fish is nae always what you thought it'd be when it bit the line.
The fisherwoman who caught me, she knew of a nearby world with a great multitude o' fishies: Koboh.
The flesh burns!
The flower is most intricate and beautiful, but its spines are so sharp that it is best observed from afar.
The flustered Lateron redirects his suspicions to Cal's guest, Zee.
The foot unleashed!
The frightful Rayfish is known tae stun its quarry with a blindin' flash o' light.
The galaxy is vast, droid.
The galaxy will know our story!
The game will be here when you wish to face your next challenger.
The gang agrees that the lead is worth checking out.
The garden can use your talents.
The garden is fully expanded. Well done, Cal! This, of course, comes with benefits.
The garden resonates with you.
The garrison is ineffective, otherwise we would not be needed at all.
The garrison's half empty.
The good eye, that is.
The great space whale - still sporting the Grapnel's imprint on her side - emerged from a parted void!
The grenade is in fact out.
The ground is covered in ferrocrete, now. All part of an Imperial control zone.
The grunt pins poor Turgle down and gives him a devastating shock.
The guide has fractured. Who will mend the bone?
The hardshell is exposed!
The heavy guns are silenced.
The heist of the century. Every bounty hunter in the galaxy was after me.
The hell I'm riskin' my neck on gang turf.
The hell!
The holotactics game at the cantina scratches the itch without getting credits involved.
The honor is mine, Cal.
The hour approaches for you to make Dagan's vision real once more.
The humidity is affecting my scanners.
The hunt is on - a Jedi is out there!
The hunt is on.
The hunt is on.
The infantry could learn a thing or two from you.
The infantry don't put up enough of a fight.
The intruder escaped up there. 
The intruder has been identified as the Jedi terrorist Cal Kestis. Bring him to me alive!
The intruder is attempting escape. 
The intruder is below. 
The intruder is here!
The intruder is now above. 
The intruder is weak!
The intruder is weak. 
The intruder's in my quarters!
The invaders. Don't worry, I'm not programmed to fight.
The joints in my armor are so obvious. Anyone could get right in-between them.
The key to Tanalorr is in that array. If you do not hurry I fear it will be lost forever.
The key to Tanalorr was sealed away, for centuries now.
The key to Tanalorr...
The key we have been searching for.
The kind of challenge I seek would likely be too much for you, soldier.
The kriffin' B2 droids!
The laboratory is off-limits. The laboratory is inaccessible.
The land will provide.
The landing pad's clear, I'm gonna bring the Mantis in now.
The last flametrooper is down. 
The last one.
The last thing I saw was his dread smile, crooked like a bayman's backbone.
The leg has been removed!
The less you know, the better. Trust me.
The lift isn't here.
The lift isn't here.
The likelihood of your destruction is extremely high.
The local voorpak just gave birth to a litter of voorlings. That's nice, right?
The longer we linger here, the more danger we are in.
The longer we wait, the bolder these Raiders grow.
The longer we wait, the more will arrive...
The machines are destroyed.
The main bridge is active, think we can get across that chasm?
The many rivers, vlotti trout leaping over the current. And the food. That I crave.
The master holotactician has returned to show off his skills.
The melee fighters are eliminated.
The memory seems to have been resolved.
The metal beast told me tae present me tribute tae the Bedlam Raiders.
The might of a Jedi!
The mogu is getting mad.
The mogu is pounding some ground...ing.
The moment the Grapnel hit orbit, her klaxons began tae sing!
The monstrous Captain Whett, his crew, and meself fled aboard the pirate schooner of the Filthy Zephyrs!
The moon? Who knows? Who cares? I don't got time for moons.
The more people in your life, the more you can lose, ya know?
The more we strive to break the cycle, the more we embody it...
The more you plant, the more you bond.
The more you talk, the longer it'll be until you see 'em again.
The most glorious creature I'd ever beheld. A whale of marvelous proportion -
The mountain don't neither. You be careful!
The mountains are barriers. The path between is truth.
The mountains...
The name's Kili Oso, but the Guild knows him as 'The Closer'. He's brought a small army to Jedha lookin' for ya.
The network's resources are stretched thin, and some local leaders are unwilling to accept the risks.
The new fellow. Howdy.
The next generation of Jedi.
The next mornin', she meets with the marauders alone, if you can believe it.
The next time a raider picks on me...
The next will be mine!
The odds have spoken, I'm afraid.
The old man was strong, sharp - grumpy enough to curdle clear water, too.
The old one-two.
The one and only!
The one who ruined our town.
The one-eyed emerald holds a leaking barrel. His voice shatters stars.
The ones I program, yeah.
The ones from the building in the valley?
The only failures are personal failures, trooper.
The only good Jedi is a dead Jedi.
The only good thing was the influx of new, more ridiculous chumps to make fun of.
The organic is weak.
The organic is weak.
The others - friends of yours?
The others sometimes call me 'the droid', 'cos I'm so unemotional.
The outpost is lucky to have you.
The outpost locals are disparaging of the Raiders.
The outpost locals do fear us.
The outpost locals will fear us.
The outpost, yes. I wonder how much of our old home remains...
The pain! More!
The pair run diagnostics on the ship; the gyro control module is completely shot, and will need replacing. 
The party agrees and Greez assigns him as "temporary co-pilot."
The past is a chain.
The path that we must walk is not always immediately visible to us.
The patrols should pass soon. When they do, you will be free to come and go as you please.
The people who lived here worshipped the Jedi.
The pilgrims used to come this way. There must be shelter nearby.
The plainsong, Brother.
The planet ran out of atmosphere!
The plants need me.
The ponchos alone!
The poor garpon - despite its rarity - is a delicacy for the black o' heart and the rumbly o' belly.
The power to the ship then fails, and the ship enters freefall.
The price of treason is death, Jedi.
The primary motivator. Scavengers will pay top credit for them.
The prospectors didn't stand a chance.
The question will come someday. Be ready.
The rage of two hundred years!
The raiding.
The ranged attackers are finished.
The rat evades!
The rat has teeth!
The recon droids failed.
The remaining Anchorites have scattered.
The renegade Jedi, Cal Kestis.
The rest of you keep fighting!
The rest of you will stay here.
The right color could make this plant pop.
The risky part's gonna be taking off again and the last thing I want is to be stuck on this haunted rock!
The rocks are pretty, in a strange sort of way.
The room? Oh kid, you're going to love it.
The ruins are singing.
The ruins of a temple of Force worshippers, in the northern desert.
The ruins on this planet are fascinating!
The safe house is hidden in the temple waterways.
The safe house is in there?
The same as you have devoted your life to - to collect and preserve knowledge of the Jedi tradition.
The same could be said for the entire galaxy, could it not?
The sandstorm has favored us. It likely obscured any signs of passage.
The scrapyard was impressive. Like a cemetery of the war.
The sear of a blade is more potent than any blaster!
The senator is expecting us.
The senator requested I bring the prisoner to him 'alive'. He is breathing, isn't he?
The sentry droid!
The shell absorbs blaster fire, be careful!
The shell came off!
The shiff-shiff, the wide-winged rok, the diver...
The ships are leaving. There is no time, I suggest you both join us.
The shuttles are leaving.
The shuttles are leaving.
The shuttles are leaving. I will not return.
The signal!
The size of it.
The size of it...
The skies are so much clearer here, even despite the abyss, and the debris.
The skies around here can get pretty dangerous.
The sky is broken.
The sky is broken. The Masters are gone.
The sky is broken. We've been attacked.
The smudge of dirt on your pants, a whiff of adrenaline. Your eyes dart for danger, alert.
The snake is here. 
The sooner the better.
The sooner there are none at all, the better.
The sooner we get the Hidden Path set up there, the better.
The sooner we get to Greez, the sooner we can -
The sooner you're gone, the sooner you're back!
The sound's coming from up ahead.
The sounds of the wild can come from creatures that kill you.
The spamel are this way, Cal.
The spamel must've found shelter. This way.
The spamel's scared, it's fighting me.
The spamel.
The stars swirled about like a hundred thousand fishies, until, suddenly, I saw a planet below!
The storm covered our tracks, but the Empire destroyed one of your speeders.
The storm is coming. I will rest when we arrive at Cere's base.
The storm nears. We must go.
The stormtrooper cadets are eager, but reckless.
The strong survive. 
The strong will ever dominate the weak.
The strong will root out the weak.
The surrounding rock formations offer natural camouflage, and even orbital scanners cannot pierce the stone.
The symmetry, the hand-feel, the way it stays cool in the Koboh heat. It all keeps me calm.
The table is calling.
The tale continues! When we last spoke, I warned of the Grapnel's arrival...
The target escaped.
The target has Jedi powers.
The target has escaped, again. 
The target has stims.
The target has vanished.
The target is quick.
The target is swift.
The target is weak.
The target will be destroyed before reaching melee range.
The temperature has shifted.
The temple's this way.
The temple. Dagan was going to train initiates in the Force there.
The tempo helps me relax. Gets my mind off all the anxiety and chaos out there.
The thought crossed my mind.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The thought of killing that Jedi is the only thing keeping us all going.
The threat must be found.
The top spot could yet be yours.
The traitor is a threat.
The traitor is below us. 
The traitor is dangerous!
The traitor is down there!
The traitor is not to be underestimated.
The traitor made short work of those things.
The treasures you seek will not enrich you.
The trespassers...
The troopers lack spine - they require more discipline.
The trouble is we're not the only ones looking for this place.
The truth is that I'm still struggling. Every day brings its own test.
The tuner is mine!
The two of us have to look out for each other, right?
The usual.
The valley breeze is rare, but wonderful.
The view makes me sad and happy, weird right...
The vines? Yes, they sprouted overnight! But there's so much more to discover.
The wailer bird, the three-footed noor, the dancing spin...
The walkers will breach the perimeter soon!
The way Greez tells it, the Abyss is a ship graveyard. And now we're on a lunar graveyard.
The way I hear it, things got bloody real quick.
The way Zeik was lookin' at me with his crazy eyes - I swear, if Cal weren't there, I would have been six feet under.
The way he tells the story, seems you gave him a lift, too.
The way is sealed, outlander.
The weak deserve to perish. 
The weak die - like that!
The weak die.
The weak die.
The weak die.
The weak follow, or die.
The weak follow, or die. Choose your fate, Jedi.
The weak follow, or the weak die.
The weak follow, or the weak die.
The weak must be destroyed
The weak must die.
The weather has cleared.
The weather report is cloudy with a hundred percent chance of Star Destroyer.
The whole crew.
The whole squad is down...
The wide-brimmed leaves provide shade for the thin stem, which can blister in the heat very easily, you know.
The wildlife is thriving here.
The wind whispers paths of sand. A blotted sun, a shadowed hand.
The wind's picked up from the north.
The winds are with us now.
The wisdom you've recovered is a boon to us all.
The wise one who instructed Master Junda!
The world bends to the will of the Force, as such it may also bend to you.
The yacht has to stop sometime.
The yacht's just over there.
The...it's mining...do I look like a miner to you!?
Theatrics.
Theatrics.
Their carbines are silenced.
Their claws are so dense they'll knock you out cold.
Their close-quarters fighters are done.
Their death in battle is preferable to cowardice.
Their deaths mean nothing!
Their defeat is imminent.
Their due reward.
Their flame troopers are finished.
Their guard is shattered!
Their have their uses.
Their heavy guns are silenced!
Their numbers fall every cycle.
Their riflemen are no more.
Their saliva is corrosive - stay away!
Their security droids are all downed.
Their shells absorb energy - preserve your fire!
Their style is effective.
Then I am, too.
Then I caught sight of the most pathetic, bumbling prospector ever to walk the planet: Rumsy Forlo.
Then I guess there's still hope, isn't there?
Then I hope he stays out of range - that would be great!
Then I hope today's the day!
Then I must go it alone.
Then I remembered I hate the outdoors.
Then I suppose I'll hold out hope for Turgle's extradition.
Then I think the Jedi will fix 'em up for you, just in a different way.
Then I will be particularly imaginative.
Then I will be truly free.
Then I'd better look around.
Then I'll delight in tearing him limb from limb.
Then I'll get other droids to guard the cliff.
Then I'll work my slicer magic.
Then Rayvis will reward me.
Then activate emergency reserves. Do I have to tell you how to do everything?
Then again, I never liked fire either.
Then at least I shall remember you!
Then bam! Raiders, from nowhere.
Then documenting, noting, logging.
Then forge on, Jedi, and see how you fare.
Then get ready.
Then grab 'em all. If the modification helps her kill, she's adding it to her build.
Then grab 'em all. If the modification helps her kill, she's adding it to her build.
Then he senses something I do not.
Then how about paying off that brute and his gang so I can drink undisturbed?
Then how will I get to you?
Then hurry up, soldier! We don't have time for rookie mistakes.
Then introduce yourself!
Then it is a good thing you have a guide.
Then it is good this path was designed to guide the winds.
Then it is likely much worse by now.
Then it's all yours.
Then it's what you'll die for!
Then let's hurry.
Then maybe you could finally repair the well's water purifier.
Then our cause will make good use of you.
Then our victory is assured.
Then perhaps we will go sometime.
Then perhaps you will explain to me the paradox of the fifth book?
Then plug your ears.
Then quit scrapbooking and tell me how you're gonna get that corroded core out.
Then remain in that state.
Then she lives up to her name. If I were you, I'd ride that thing until the thrusters fell off.
Then shoot it more!
Then stop complaining!
Then that's our target.
Then they will be judged insufficient.
Then they will pay for their crimes.
Then this isn't goodbye. Splendid!
Then today may be your lucky day. Hope you're prepared.
Then until this Raider situation is under control, let the music play on.
Then watched those same minds ooze into obscurity while real opportunity whistled by.
Then we can't stay out here, we're too exposed.
Then we cannot give them the chance to attack.
Then we go out fighting.
Then we go through them.
Then we go together.
Then we must find another way across.
Then we must turn this to our advantage!
Then we stand together.
Then we take the senator to Saw Gerrera?
Then we vaporize 'em, and that's that.
Then we will deal with them together.
Then we will take care of them.
Then we'll kill them and take it.
Then we'll regroup at the rendezvous point.
Then we'll stop them.
Then we'll take a more direct approach.
Then we've still got time.
Then what are you waiting for?
Then what was the point in coming here at all!?
Then what would I do with no suit?
Then what's ten more, huh?
Then what's the point of being out here!?
Then what?
Then when the time is right I will strike out and cleanse this galaxy with fire.
Then why did you bother to rescue her? You hardly know her!
Then why do you have one?
Then why the long face?
Then why would ye try tae give one to a fisherman?
Then why'd you become a prospector?
Then yeah.
Then you are subordinate to me.
Then you be a fool, m'lad. Ma sordid tale will bring ye nothin' but grief and woe.
Then you know how deadly those things are.
Then you must find a way in.
Then you would know of good places to eat here?
Then you'd better get started.
Then you're a fool.
Then you're in good company. Now, let's take a closer look.
Then you're nothing. Me, I got a little. Worked all day for it.
Then you're sweating so much.
Then you've got about as good an eye as me.
Then your master chose poorly.
Then your processes aren't as dull as the others. You're right, this won't be easy.
Then, all of a sudden, the tibidee snatches my brother and takes  flight.
Then, as they say, I've still got it.
Then, the Empire tore through. Shot and trampled anything that got in their way.
There appears to be a malfunction.
There are a lot of you around here, aren't there?
There are children in the Hidden Path. Perhaps she will make some friends.
There are countless ruins scattered across the high desert. One of them could be a perfect safe house for the Path.
There are creatures here.
There are dive cantinas on this planet that'll spin you five ways from sunup.
There are many wars, but little honor to be won from them.
There are most likely Anchorites still hiding on Jedha.
There are multiple Jedi at this location. Inform the Inquisitorius at once.
There are munitions up there. We must climb.
There are no protocols for this!
There are only so many of those, y'know!
There are others like this on Koboh where we will test and train your abilities.
There are reports of hostiles in the area. Should we send out another scouting party?
There are scant few Faa left, on account of their succulent glands.
There are so many more of us!
There are some downright stubborn stains in the kitchen from the last time Greez grilled up shiverpede steaks.
There are too many...
There are traitors here, and I won't rest until they are found!
There are traitors hiding throughout the galaxy. Trust our orders and you will be rewarded. 
There aren't - and I'm not scouting. Leave me in peace.
There aren't - and I'm not scouting. Leave me in peace.
There aren't any Purge Troopers around...right?
There aren't many who could match your zeal.
There can be no escape for any enemy, especially not Jedi scum.
There can be only victory.
There could be more of them around.
There goes a B2 arm.
There goes it's arm!
There goes it's shell.
There goes my fun.
There goes my promotion.
There goes my score!
There goes my score!
There goes my tactical advantage.
There goes my thruster pack.
There goes our bounty. 
There goes our last Viper droid!
There goes our score!
There goes our score!
There goes that shell!
There goes the last rocket trooper!
There had better be.
There has been an error.
There has to be a few more tunes out there for you to bring me.
There hasn't been a mark worth his time. Until now.
There have gotta be other planets more deserving of a garrison.
There he goes again. 
There he goes!
There he goes. 
There he goes. Scared him. 
There he is!
There he is!
There he is!
There he is!
There he is!
There he is!
There he is! Shoot to kill!
There he is, high and mighty.
There he is.
There he is.
There he is.
There he is.
There he is. Got your first target lined up.
There he is. I see him.
There he is. Quickly now.
There he is: my favorite scrapper.
There is a Jedi in the area. I hope you are ready to serve, trooper.
There is a Jedi intruder. He must be found.
There is a bounty for this Jedi.
There is a darkness here. You feel it too, yes?
There is a mogu.
There is a site built by those who revered Force users in the northern desert.
There is a site, quite an ancient one at that, in the northern desert.
There is absolutely no way...
There is an insect. Would you like me to blast it?
There is an invader on the other side. Open it now!
There is an obvious reason why they do not.
There is another way to reach Tanalorr.
There is another way to reach Tanalorr.
There is beauty in emptiness.
There is immense power in such emotions but you were too weak!
There is much for us all to do.
There is much the galaxy has to show you.
There is much they have yet to learn.
There is much to do.
There is no end. That's the objective of a patrol - we always keep moving.
There is no escape from my power!
There is no escape from us!
There is no escape!
There is no escape.
There is no escape.
There is no escape.
There is no escape.
There is no greater blessing.
There is no greater challenge than being ever-vigilant in the name of the Empire.
There is no greater example of the Imperial hand of justice.
There is no greater glory than to engage in battle.
There is no higher service than crushing traitors for the glory of the Empire.
There is no mention of credit reallocation in our mission objectives.
There is no need to record this
There is no place to go!
There is no running.
There is no skill in this.
There is no thrill in incinerating villages, no hunt.
There is no victory without patience.
There is nothing left but death.
There is nothing out here.
There is nothing right about what happened here.
There is nothing to do... on this rock! Nothing to challenge us!
There is nothing to this!
There is nowhere to hide.
There is nowhere to run!
There is only death!
There is only the Force...
There is only the fight!
There is something I am seeking. Maybe you can help.
There is something unique about it, no?
There is still time for us to reach an agreement!
There is still time, time to go, to walk away!
There it goes!
There it is again!
There it is again!
There it is!
There it is! Bring it down!
There it is! Bring it down!
There it is.
There it is.
There ma pod crashed, and there was I rescued by kindly locals.
There may be a Jedi around, but our orders are to remain here and guard.
There might be chambers and tunnels out here. We'll have to proceed on foot.
There must be more to Zee than we realized, something scrambled up in her memory banks.
There must be something more to Zee than we realized. Something scrambled up in her memory banks.
There now, that better? There's a good Nekko.
There she is!
There she is.
There should be an entire platoon on these docks by now.
There should now be more than enough goodness in the soil to boost the plant's growth.
There surely can't be many of them left now. I hear they're like ghosts.
There they are! Deploy the battalion.

There's still something missing.

There, Bode.
There, Merrin.
There, amongst the brine and black, I found 'em:
There, now you can get to it.
There, see it?
There, that should do it!
There, there!
There, uh...aren't any Zabrak hanging out in the outpost, right?
There.
There. Above us.

There. Your new home.
Thermal detonator out!
Thermal vents.
These Anchorites keep bugging me about my cooking techniques. I'm just trying to make some grub!
These Imperials won't leave us alone!
These Imps were mere fodder, come at me! I still lust for the battle Dagan promised us.
These Raiders are keeping the Empire at bay. At least they're good for something.
These Raiders are nothing but killers.
These Raiders kill for sport. And made a lotta those beasts much more hostile to us.
These are all over Cere's base.
These are all wastes of processor functions.
These are cheap tricks, Jedi!
These are nothing.
These are sure to grow into something interesting.
These are tasks that cannot be left to the infantry.

These detonators are faulty!
These dolts, reveling as if things are better.
These don't look like any Separatists I remember.
These droids ain't seen an upgrade since The Clone Wars.
These droids are good for one thing: gettin' between me and a blaster.
These droids are merely pawns, but useful ones.
These droids are so old. Think they'll ever upgrade 'em?
These droids have no loyalty to Rayvis.
These foothills are now Imperial territory. Our orders are to keep the locals from trespassing.

These will tear you apart!
These would be right at home in the garden.
They - they killed her!
They ain't even gonna remember our names, kid.
They ain't rollin' no more.
They almost remind me of early astrogation techniques. Rough estimates compared to our modern star charts.
They already have what they came for. They're back at their fortress feeling safe, complacent.
They already scanned that at the checkpoint.
They always leave a trail somewhere.

They cannot fall into the Empire's hands. No matter the price.
They cannot have gotten far.
They cannot hunt without sight, and they are blind to the subtle life of the desert.

They chose the wrong side.
They continue after we're gone?
They could conquer a whole planet with this...
They could not resist.
They couldn't beat you. I can.
They couldn't have put this laboratory in a sunnier place?
They demand half of all of our exports in exchange for protection.
They deserved that.

They destroyed the bridge to the warehouse recently. Too bad you can't just glide over.
They did not survive the Imperial occupation.
They did not track us.
They didn't exactly prioritize ventilation, ya know?
They didn't expect us outsmarting them, huh buddy?
They didn't take kindly to being silenced by the Empire - and they're planning to do something about it.
They dishonored me.
They ditched you?
They do not live long enough to rust.
They don't got what it takes.
They don't like that.
They don't need the shell to survive, it's like a big shield!
They don't seem to be stopping.
They dreamed together,
They drop any useful info? Any hints on defeating one?
They dwelt far below the ice, where warm currents danced like ribbons in the wind.
They feel that priorite is their chance at a better life.
They fled - coward.
They found us!
They gather near the base. Follow me.

They just sit right there, right on the table, as if to say, 'Here, Greez, you clean me.'
They just won't lay off the trigger!

They keep talking about this "new unit." Empire's full of surprises.
They kill people fast and painful, that's what's important.
They knew the risks!
They knew what they signed up for.
They lack rocket support.
They like to keep their prey alive. Barely. For the, uh, flavor.
They lost one!
They love tae nestle into the cozier reaches of the sea - but they're nae too cozy fer Skoova Stev!
They made themselves a little village on the far side of the valley.
They mark the path to Pilgrim's Sanctuary.
They mask themselves and abandon their names in dedication to their purpose.
They may have the old girl, but we've got a crew on the case that could pin the tail on a wild gundark.
They might seem harmless, but half of them are cultists in disguise.
They must all die!
They must be around here somewhere. Should we call it in?
They must be near.
They must have left that part off by mistake.
They must have shot this drop pod all the way from the Lucrehulk.
They must not know.
They must think you need someone responsible with you.
They narrowly avoid hitting the surface.
They need those arms!
They need those legs!
They needed that to walk!
They never learn.
They never see me coming...and that's when I get them!
They never stood a chance.
They only fight to protect their home. Oh, or as a mating ritual.

They're...worthless. I wouldn't be able to sell them.

They've lost their launchers!
They've lost their valuable ranged attackers.
They've sent one of their best gunslingers to Jedha, complete with droid backup.
They've taken a lot of people.
Thing's useless now.
Things are actually looking up.
Things are getting heated.
Things are looking good for Cal!
Things are only getting worse out there.
Things have certainly gotten better.
Things take a dark turn and Dagan reveals himself to be obsessed with Tanalorr and a power he discovered there. 
Things were good until they weren't. That's how it is with Sorc - he'll sell you out for a stale Turbo Dog.
Things weren't this easy in the war.
Things worked out okay in the end.
Things, uh, haven't been the same since the team split up.
Think BD wants you to knock that down.

Think again!
Think anyone's home?
Think it could be Dagan?
Think it crashed, or was it brought down by something?
Think it was a set-up?
Think it's a coordinated attack?
Think of all the Jedi who came through here.
Think of the rewards, Shana. Come on!
Think she'll find her place?
Think so.
Think so. But it wasn't what we expected.
Think so. I've learned a lot from Cere.
Think that creature's a heavy sleeper?
Think that'll hurt me?

Think we can make it?
Think we can ride that updraft across?
Think we can ride that updraft?
Think we can score some free drinks?
Think we can use this elsewhere?
Think we could use that same orb again?
Think we found Greez's pest problem.
Think we should check that out?
Think we should check that out?
Think you can break that coupling?
Think you can escape?
Think you can fly?
Think you can get the drop on me?
Think you can go shot-for-shot with me?
Think you can jumpstart that thing, BD?
Think you can keep up?
Think you can knock down that crate?
Think you can land?
Think you can outrun us?
Think you can pull a fast one on us?
Think you can run?
Think you can run?
Think you can run?
Think you can slice it?
Think you can take us all?
Think you can translate this?
Think you made the cut? Think you are worthy in the eyes of Dagan Gera?
Think you'll fare well against this Jedi? Seems like a tough customer.
Think you'll last?
Think you're so tough?
Think you've got it, Cal.
Think your tough stuff?
Thinkin those Raiders are overworking us.
Thinkin' about it. Wouldn't hold yer breath, though.
Thinkin' it means we're about to make a pretty big problem.
Thinking of extending out my hut.
This Bilemaw is blaster-fodder.
This Empire will not hesitate to destroy us if we are discovered.
This Gorger's got some fight!
This Jedi better be well trained. I have expectations.
This Jedi better have been well trained. I long for a real fight.
This Jedi fears us greatly. 
This Jedi is a serious threat.
This Jedi is all tricks and games.
This Jedi is clever.
This Jedi is dangerous. 
This Jedi is dangerous. 
This Jedi is dexterous.
This Jedi is just a loose end from the Clone Wars. He'll be dealt with. 
This Jedi is powerful.
This Jedi is surprising.
This Jedi isn't so bad.
This Jedi must be a fool.
This Jedi will make a fine trophy!
This Jedi will never understand - we do this for a higher purpose, something so much more than them.
This Jedi...
This Kili sounds like trouble.
This Koboh matter is blocking our way out.
This Shyyyo bird feather's supposed to bring good luck. Huh.
This again.
This ain't my fight.
This ain't no prospector, you know. It's a bonafide Jedi Knight. You ready to fight something like that?
This ain't right!
This ain't worth dying over.
This all used to mean something...
This always clears my head.
This ancient place lies to the far west of the desert.
This archive will burn.
This area is under the control of the Bedlam Raiders.
This area's on lockdown.
This area's secure. Nothing out here would dare challenge the Empire.
This assignment can't end fast enough.
This base is now on lockdown. An intruder has been identified. Bring him to me, immediately!
This base is well-hidden.
This bass line is giving me gutter-funk vibes.
This battle is over.
This battle offers freedom or death to us both, Jedi!
This beast can and will crush you.
This beast comes to challenge us!
This beast does not frighten me.
This beast is a significant threat.
This beast is no challenge.
This beast is no match for us.
This beast is nothing.
This beast is powerful - careful!
This beast will fall.
This beast's angry.
This became unpleasant.
This belongs with you.
This better be worth it.
This better hit him.
This better not bite me!
This bilemaw can't defeat us!
This bilemaw is in our way!
This bilemaw is our problem now.
This bird is hardly worth my time.
This blasted...helmet...
This book is a copy from the Jedi archive.
This bounty is mine. 
This bounty's for the taking!
This building is definitely different than the rest.
This can't be real...
This can't be!
This can't happen!
This cannot hold me!
This cannot kill us - nothing can!
This cave is huge. Seems too much for prospectors...
This cave is huge. Think the Republic was here?
This cavern will be your tomb.
This changes nothing.
This chiffin' thing!
This child fears us. 
This conversation is only a test
This could be better somewhere else.
This could be it.
This could be worth my time.
This could bring some color to the garden.
This could get pretty ugly, BD.
This could go somewhere else.
This creature can and will bite.
This creature has a strong defense.
This creature is a threat.
This creature is fearsome, but no match!
This creature is mine.
This creature is resistant.
This creature is significant.
This creature must be eliminated.
This creature must die.
This crew is led by a Jedi. You must be in top form.
This critter is blaster fodder.
This crusade of yours is hopeless, Jedi!
This dam was all that was holding the tar back. When it broke...
This day can't get any worse.
This day just keeps getting worse.
This defies expectation.
This desert seems like it goes on forever.
This district is locked down. Senator's orders.
This does not compute.
This does not look good...
This does nothing. 
This doesn't compute.
This doesn't compute. 
This doesn't have to get ugly. I just need to pass through.
This doesn't hurt. 
This doesn't make any sense...
This doesn't make sense!
This doesn't seem equitable, Cal.
This doesn't seem right...
This door's not budging. 
This drink is only for the righteous.
This drink is terrible.
This droid is in the way!
This droid is useless!
This droid's got more than a screw loose...
This encounter will be difficult.
This endless patrolling has yielded little in the way of results.
This ends now!
This ends now!
This ends now!
This ends now.
This ends now.
This ends soon. 
This ends, now.
This enemy has tricks.
This entire structure is the Array.
This fight isn't done.
This fight will be remembered!
This flora is fascinating. I can't figure it out.
This fog's making our sensors malfunction. At least you're still operational.
This galaxy is in chaos. I seek clarity of mind.
This galaxy is in turmoil, and we need the wisdom of those who came before us.
This galaxy suffers, but there is still beauty.
This garden's got room to grow.
This gets Greez's attention, as he's heard of Tanalorr in local legends - that it was a lost world filled with treasure.
This guard will crumble!
This guy does not give up. Gotta respect that.
This guy is pretty bad.
This guy is ruthless.
This guy likes to catch his prey off-guard, so watch your back.
This guy looks hungry.
This guy's moving in with his stealth squad so make sure not to get blindsided.
This guy's tearin' through our troops.
This guy's tearin' through our troops.
This guy's wild!
This had 'you' written all over it.
This hardshell is going down.
This hardshell is mine.
This hardshell is tenacious.
This has Khri written all over it.
This has been a great first date and all, but I still haven't gotten paid.
This has been here for a long time.
This has escalated.
This has gotta be the place Cordova was talking about.
This has your name on it!
This how you treat all your friends?
This intruder is nothing. He will be set right, shown the way.
This is Bode Akuna.
This is Bode's doing.
This is Commander Denvik.
This is Commander Denvik. Let me be the first to welcome our guests from the Inquisitorius.
This is Denvik. Lock down the hangar, no one leaves this base until the Jedi has been killed!
This is Jedi power.
This is Koboh Matter?
This is Merrin.
This is Raider turf! Die!
This is a Jedi and that is a laser sword.
This is a Jedi's power!?
This is a Jedi.
This is a Jedi.
This is a Jedi?
This is a bad plan. There's an Imperial garrison on that mountain.
This is a capable killer.
This is a diversion.
This is a fine battle.
This is a good bounty.
This is a harsh place, but it grows on you.
This is a luxury yacht?
This is a mistake. 
This is a new one. I bet Pili has more information.
This is a nice one.
This is a placeholder line for a deleted dialogue asset. The dialogue you tried to play has been deleted in Heckle.
This is a secure channel. How did you -
This is a smart operation Cere's put together.
This is a smuggler's tunnel. It came with the cantina.
This is a sound strategy.
This is a unique piece.
This is a waste of time.
This is above my paygrade.
This is acceptable.
This is actually going well.
This is all a big misunderstanding. Honest! Ya gotta let me go!
This is an inspection. You have orders to let me pass.
This is an odd place for a garden.
This is as far as we go!
This is as good as any laser sword.
This is better than any score!
This is boring. 
This is boring. I'm bored.
This is by the book.
This is child's play.
This is disadvantageous.
This is distressing.
This is encouraging. I bet we can plant even more.
This is evidence of your treason!
This is extremely unusual.
This is fine. Totally fine.
This is for me!
This is for me.
This is for the Brood!
This is for you!
This is for you!
This is frivolous.
This is fun!
This is fun!
This is fun!
This is fun, huh, BD?
This is fun.
This is fun.
This is fun.
This is fun.
This is futile!
This is gettin' dangerous!
This is getting annoying.
This is getting away from me.
This is going bad fast...
This is going to be fun!
This is going to hurt, a lot.
This is going... okay!
This is gonna hurt!
This is gonna hurt.
This is gonna look great on my record.
This is great, right, buddy?
This is highly irregular.
This is him, Doma! This is the one who stood up to the Bedlam Raiders!
This is home, now?
This is hopeless!
This is how Bedlam Raiders fight!
This is how a real droid does it.
This is how we do it on Koboh!
This is important. 
This is incredible. Where are we?
This is interesting.
This is irregular.
This is irregular. 
This is irregular. 
This is it for us!
This is it for you!
This is it for you!
This is it for you, Jedi!
This is it!
This is it!
This is it!
This is it! Hurry and get him!
This is it, Sejan's yacht. What a mess. 
This is it. 
This is it. Keep pushing. I'll cover you from the skies.
This is it. The home stretch. Can't stop now.
This is just for you.
This is just perfect, Bhima. I told you we should have hired a guide!
This is just what we scrappers do. We grab anything that looks valuable -
This is meaningless!
This is more valuable than the scrolls you currently have.
This is most alarming.
This is my best friend.
This is my business. The prisoner needs to be in mint condition.
This is my favorite part.
This is my fourteenth patrol.
This is my home now!
This is my home, now.
This is my tower! What do you want?
This is never going to end.
This is never going to end...
This is new.
This is new?!
This is no challenge.
This is no common anarchist but a devotee of the treasonous Jedi Order.
This is no time for jokes, Cal. Somebody should, I don't know, start a town collective.
This is no time to let up, Cal.
This is no typical Jedi!
This is not a fair fight.
This is not according to original regulation. This will have to be processed.
This is not fighting.
This is not how gravity works!
This is not how today was meant to go!
This is not intended functionality.
This is not my day to die!
This is not my fault.
This is not over yet.
This is not over!
This is not possible!
This is not possible.
This is not the way. We are lost.
This is not what I signed up for.
This is not where we die.
This is not your forté!
This is nothing - nothing!
This is nothing.
This is nothing.
This is only a setback.
This is our Empire. We must all fight to protect it.
This is our home - you'll die here!
This is our home!
This is our moment!
This is outside of parameters.
This is over, for now.
This is pointless!
This is pointless.
This is proving to be wonderful exercise!
This is quite the display.
This is real power.
This is really not pleasant.
This is some fight.
This is splendid technology you've unearthed, Cal.
This is strange....
This is the Force!
This is the army that ended the mighty Jedi Order?
This is the best a Jedi can do?
This is the best part.
This is the easiest mission ever.
This is the end for me!
This is the end for you.
This is the end game, boys! Let's bring this Jedi in!
This is the end!
This is the end.
This is the end.
This is the fight I've wanted.
This is the find of a century!
This is the first I'm hearing about it!
This is the former champion of Sorc Tormo's arena? I'm not impressed.
This is the good stuff!
This is the most fun I've had since landing on this rock.
This is the only way to keep you safe!
This is the site of an ancient monastery, one long abandoned.
This is the strength of a Jedi!
This is the stuff of legends!
This is the third temple we've raided! What's so interesting about Jedha anyways?
This is too easy, rat!
This is too easy.
This is too much for you!
This is unbelievable!
This is unexpected.
This is unorthodox.
This is weak - you're weak!
This is what Bode wants.
This is what I live for!
This is what I signed up for.
This is what I wanted.
This is what we expected.
This is what you deserve.
This is where you held up an Imperial senator?
This is why I hunt.
This is your captain speaking, inviting you to grab some seat so we can land.
This is your end. 
This is your end. 
This is your invention, no one else understands it. You're the only one who can guide me back.
This is your ship, Greez. I kept it just the way you left it.
This is your spot, huh.
This is, umm, protocol.
This isn't calming my nerves like I thought it would...
This isn't fair!
This isn't fair. 
This isn't fighting.
This isn't going so good.
This isn't good, but isn't bad either.
This isn't good, this is not good.
This isn't good.
This isn't goood!
This isn't how it ends, not for me!
This isn't just a last goodbye.
This isn't just any target - it's a Jedi.
This isn't my first placement, far from it. But it is my first Jedi.
This isn't over yet.
This isn't over yet.
This isn't over, Jedi.
This isn't quite right.
This isn't right.
This isn't the first time the ISB has tried to infiltrate Saw Gerrera's organization.
This isn't the time to fight.
This isn't very inviting.
This job couldn't have gone more wrong...
This job is fun!
This just in: you talk so much...
This just makes it more fun.
This kind of deal is best done in the shadows.
This language is ancient. Hope that's not a warning.
This leads up to the bridge.
This looks promising.
This makes no sense. You did not want it. It looks foolish.
This material has real style.
This may result in my destruction.
This might be a fair fight.
This might be a tough one.
This might be it for you.
This might be valuable at the outpost.
This might burn.
This might do something.
This might make you die a little.
This might surprise you, but I've been pushed around my whole life.
This might take a while.
This mogu is my prey.
This mudscuffer picked up your trail outside the outpost.
This must be the place!
This must be the structure Toa told us about.
This must be where Santari Khri intended to send Zee.
This must end quickly.
This needs power. 
This new arm I got makes piloting a little different...
This not optimal.
This one ain't messin' around!
This one ain't messin' around.
This one cannot beat us.
This one has fight in him. 
This one has some skill. 
This one is about to be.
This one is dangerous
This one is dangerous!
This one is dead.
This one is mine.
This one is mine.
This one is mine. 
This one is mine. 
This one is quick. 
This one is rigid, obstinate. When the right threat arrives, it will be unable to adapt to it.
This one lacks skill!
This one looks hurt.
This one means business.
This one seems to be a duplicate.
This one will be a challenge!
This one will be tough.
This one's a bullseye.
This one's aggressive.
This one's dangerous!
This one's done.
This one's fast!
This one's for you!
This one's gonna hurt!
This one's gonna sting!
This one's good!
This one's good!
This one's got some moves. 
This one's green. 
This one's grown enough, right?
This one's had some training.  
This one's interesting.
This one's just for you!
This one's mine!
This one's mine.
This one's mine.
This one's mine.
This one's mine.
This one's mine. 
This one's mine. 
This one's mine. 
This one's mine. 
This one's ours.
This one's quick.
This one's quick.
This one's quick.
This one's quick. 
This one's ready to go.
This one's surprisingly tough.
This one's wild!
This one.
This ones quick!
This outpost'll take your life if you're not careful.
This pain is yours.
This path is pretty tough for the common traveler.
This patrol is so easy.
This patrol makes me wonder...
This patrolling is endless. Where are the enemies of the Empire?
This piece of junk could sink any second!
This piece of junk!
This place ain't somewhere we really wanna be seen.
This place and the Forest Array are connected, BD.
This place can be so cruel.
This place could fall apart any second.
This place could use a little trouble.
This place could use some greenery. Wonder if I could find someone to help.
This place feels different now.
This place has all gone downhill ever since Pyloon's opened its doors.
This place has you seeing things.
This place is a ghost town.
This place is a hell of a sight.
This place is crawling with disgusting wildlife.
This place is everything they said it was, huh?
This place is feeling alive, but I just know there's other tunes out there.
This place is in ruins...
This place is looking great.
This place is nothing by comparison.
This place is nothing compared to my last posting.
This place is real different from where I used to live.
This place is starting to fill up, Cal! Guess the word is out.
This place is strong in the Force.
This place is terrifying at night.
This place is the dumps...everything here wants to eat you or suffocate you...
This place isn't worth dying over!
This place really keeps going downhill.
This place took its interior design tips from Dathomir.
This place violates about two dozen business fundamentals, giddily deploys false advertising practices...
This place won't hold long.
This place would be beautiful, if not for the Imperial base.
This place...
This planet got colder, somehow.
This planet has some real deep caves...
This planet is cramping my style. What say we just up and take off - hit some open space?
This planet is not your property, it is your station.
This planet is so different to Coruscant.
This planet is under the full control of the Empire.
This planet will be a haven for those hunted by the Empire.
This plant could use our help.
This plant's gonna love this.
This plant's not going anywhere.
This pleases me.
This relic of a corrupt institution destroyed by its own arrogance.
This remind you of Zeffo, too?
This reminds me of old times.
This requires examination.
This ringing in my ears is driving me crazy!
This running does nothing. 
This saloon has wonky acoustics, weirder customers and a barely functional refresher.
This say anything about the path?
This scum just took out our last commando droid!
This seems a good place for it.
This seems like a logical choice.
This shield just broke!
This shield will hold you back.
This shield will keep you back.
This shop is closed. Move along.
This shot will stop you!
This should be quick.
This should be quick. 
This should be quick. 
This should be quick. 
This should be quick. 
This should do it!
This should do it.
This should do it.
This should do it.
This should do more damage.
This should do the trick.
This should help!
This should hurt him.
This should hurt.
This should hurt.
This should hurt.
This should puncture you.
This should puncture you.
This should slow you down.
This should stop you.
This spamel has been a good companion.
This stage has seen better days.
This station is closed.
This station is closed. It is dangerous to remain here.
This strange substance is enigmatic but not beyond our ability to study and manipulate.
This stuff gets everywhere.
This stuff is ancient.
This stuff is dangerous, we need to be careful with it.
This stuff is everywhere.
This stupid thing!
This sure is a lonely planet.
This swamp?
This takes me back!
This terminal will have to wait.
This thing can and will crush you.
This thing is mine.
This thing is no match for me.
This thing is very aggressive.
This thing needs your overcharge. 
This thing will run you through.
This thing'll bite you in half!
This thing's gonna rip my arm out!
This thing's too slow for you.
This thing, right here.
This things got your name all over it.
This time tomorrow, we'll be sittin' pretty on an industrial fuel injector.
This time.
This traitor is powerful.
This trinket is broken, useless!
This ugly thing is asking for it!
This unit can defeat you.
This unit remains.
This used to be a gathering hall.
This used to be an atrium.
This valley is so vast, this gets exhausting.
This valley is unfamiliar to me.
This valley symbolizes our devotion to Rayvis.
This victory is mine alone.
This war won't be won soon.
This was always inevitable.
This was in the senator's office. It was all a set-up.
This was my third pack!
This was not the plan.
This was supposed to be my day off.
This was the holo that Dagan was watching in -
This wasn't in the briefing.
This wasn't part of the deal, ya know?
This wave coupler needs an orb to function.
This way, Cal.
This way, Jedi.
This way, Master Junda! We are nearly there.
This way.
This way.
This way.
This way. The base is not far now.
This whole Empire occupation is really getting my mucus in a knot.
This whole settlement must have been wiped out when the moon shattered.
This whole time, I always saw us as a family looking for a home.
This will be a fight to remember!
This will be a nice bounty.
This will be a true contest of minds.
This will be an easy win.
This will be easy!
This will be easy.
This will be easy.
This will be easy.
This will be easy.
This will be fun. 
This will be hard without melee support.
This will be hard without rocket troopers. 
This will be painful.
This will be quick.
This will be quick.
This will be swift.
This will be too easy. 
This will be too easy. 
This will be tough without a flametrooper. 
This will be your last mistake.
This will end you.
This will hurt.
This will hurt.
This will hurt.
This will hurt.
This will just take a minute. Or two. 
This will never end...
This will not be tolerated.
This will not be tolerated.
This will not be tolerated.
This will not hurt.
This will stop him.
This will surely end you.
This will take you down.
This will test your limits!
This won't be a problem.
This won't be easy.
This won't be worth my time.
This won't end well.
This won't end well.
This won't end well...
This won't miss!
This won't stop me.
This won't stop me. 
This won't take long.
This world is mine.
This would be a good place for it.
This you should do on your own.
This!
This! Is a Jedi?
This'll be a cinch. I'll eat this Jedi for breakfast.
This'll be easy!
This'll be easy.
This'll be easy. 
This'll be easy. 
This'll be fast.
This'll be fun!
This'll be over before it starts.
This'll be over soon.
This'll be useful.
This'll come in handy.
This'll keep us off the ground.
This'll make some noise!
This'll make some noise!
This'll speed things up.
This'll stop you!
This'll take him down.
This'll take you down.
This, though? This is something else. But it's missing one thing Lateron had.
This...
This... can't happen!
This... hasn't happened before!
This... is what I've wanted!
This...is nothing!
This...thing sold us a priceless relic.
This...this is an inspection. I have orders to let you pass!
Thorny boy's mad.

Those beasts are useless.
Those beasts don't die easily, you know.
Those beasts take no prisoners.

Those droids are tough.
Those droids are valuable.
Those droids aren't so great now, huh?

Those leg joints are tricky.
Those legs are impossible to replace!
Those legs are required.
Those lightsabers are something, huh?
Those look like Jedi...
Those mandibles are incredible - they'll rip right through armor!
Those mods on him are genius! You're used to fixing broken things too, huh?
Those monsters!
Those other droids here are such chumps. They do whatever we say. Suckers.
Those pincers are fascinating. Deadly, but fascinating!
Those pincers look sharp!
Those pincers will damage your armor.
Those powers don't scare me.
Those powers mean nothing!
Those probes didn't last long.
Those ranged units were no match for you.
Those rocket troopers are down!
Those shields did nothing!
Those shields should be stronger...
Those spikes are a defense mechanism and a weapon!
Those spikes can puncture armor.
Those spikes don't look so sharp.
Those spikes will puncture your plastoid.
Those stims won't save you.
Those stormtroopers weren't ready for these conditions.
Those talons pack a punch!

Those tin cans you like so much burn very nice, especially when they meet a lightsaber.
Those traitors will regret ever picking up a blaster.
Those tricks won't save you.
Those walkers are headed for the Archive.
Those walkers are heading for Cere's base!
Those walls won't help you. 
Those we loved are no longer here to guide us.
Those who fell to this Empire are a pale shadow compared to those from Dagan's age.
Those who revered Force-users clearly built these trials.
Those with live thermal detonators,
Those won't save you.
Those won't save you.
Those wrist rocket launchers are rare!
Those'll tear you up like nothin'!
Though we really could use someone who has a bit more fashion sense.

Threw my spear, pierced the beast straight through.
Through combat, I will prove myself.
Through here.
Through holotactics, I will improve my understanding!
Through our belief, we will bring this Jedi low. Through our belief, we will find our glory.
Through the clouds? Only a little.
Through the heart!
Through wisdom, we seek to perceive the formless pattern of the Force.

Tiresome!

Tiresome.
To Pyloon's saloon. And we hope to see ya soon.
To Tanalorr!
To Tanalorr!
To Tanalorr.
To a MagnaGuard? Despicable.
To a crisp!
To an extent. We've recovered holobooks from satellite Jedi libraries...
To be bested in combat by Dagan, to become the executor of his will...
To be effective, power must be demonstrated through the destruction of enemies.
To be honest, I had no idea if I could. But I had to believe.
To be honest, I'm not sure the kid's been around plants, but she does like to prune leaves.
To be honest, that's what really gets us through the day.
To be patrolling with me, and not a B1.
To be still is to be calm. To allow for wisdom to spring forth. Yet the galaxy is seldom static.
To defeat a Jedi is to be savored.
To dust!
To dust!
To eliminate Jedi.
To fish so scarce a quarry - on account o' the Great Fish Famine - well, it's nae a mild undertakin'.
To kill in the Emperor's name is its own reward.
To me!
To observe, report, and react to any and all threats.
To offer you something. A proposal...
To open the Forest Array.
To pieces.
To pieces.
To the Imperials, we are dune-rats in our warrens.
To the Raiders, are are pawns.
To the air!
To the death, Jedi!
To the hangar.
To the hangar.
To the victor belong the spoils.
To the victor go the spoils. And the loser's gotta convince Turgle to hit the refresher more often.
To think the Jedi Order is no more, that must have been dreadful for you!
To think, we could kill a Jedi. There aren't many left.
To your credit, you hide it well.
To your feet!
Toa mentioned this meditation chamber.
Toa on a ruin.
Toa recommended we check this chamber out.
Today and every day!
Today is a gift.
Together we found another way to survive.
Together we will beat this thing!
Together!
Together! Pursue the intruder!
Together, Cal!
Together, ready up!
Together, we are unstoppable.
Together, we bring peace and stability, but we must all know our place.
Together, we will rid the galaxy of its enemies and bring peace.
Together, we will work to build a safer, more prosperous galaxy.
Toh! Noofu bi!
Told ya.
Told you not to come here.
Tomorrow we're gonna have a new home.
Tons. Soon as somethin' breaks or the Raiders show face, folks abandon their projects.
Too Risky
Too afraid? 
Too bad you can't fly in there like those gliders.

Too hot for me!
Too hot for ya?
Too hot to handle!
Too late. Already rebooting.
Too long.
Too long.
Too many Imperials.
Too many legs!
Too many more and old Skoova won't be able to wet his flippers without slappin' a fishie!
Too many skeptics and cynics out there, Cal. You find a believer, you hold on tight.
Too many strangers these days.
Too much for ya, huh?
Too much for you!
Too much for you!
Too much for you. 
Too much for you?
Too much for you?
Too much noise for my liking.
Too much salt is bad for you.
Too much tension in the coils is bad for the joints, if you catch my drift.
Too much, huh? I'll take it. 
Too obvious.
Too on the nose. Ugh, we'll never think of a name.
Too quick for you!
Too quick!
Too quick.
Too quick. 
Too quick...
Too risky. No dealings with Rayvis.
Too scared, Jedi?

Took a round of drinks to get em back inside.
Took an arm off that BX!
Took care of that gorger.
Took down that watchtower, if that's what you're referring to.

Took it down!
Took it down!
Took it right off!
Took many of your Order to defeat me. And yet...
Took out the clankers!
Took that clean off, really!?
Took you long enough.
Top notch combat skills and an unstoppable devotion to destroying anyone who threatens the Empire.
Top of the hour. Please report your findings.
Toppled with a single swing!
Tore it to pieces.
Tore the shell off it's back!
Tore the shell right off its back!
Torn apart.

Totally get it.
Totally, Cal. A good track can be an adventure, or an escape.
Touché.
Tough break, Cal. Very tough break.
Tough guy, huh?
Tough guy, huh?
Track him. 
Tracked a Kivaroa back to its nest. It was killing livestock. No other choice but to put it down.
Trackin'.
Tracking target.

Tracking the coward.
Tracking the enemy!

Tragically, it failed - fatally - to present a consistent ontology.
Trailing the Jedi!
Train your sights on that shiverpede.
Training pays off.

Traitorous killer!

Treasure hunting types used to come here in droves.
Treasure these final breaths.
Treating your wounds?
Tremble!
Tremble!
Tremendous move by Tulli!
Trespasser detected.
Trespassin'.
Trials or not, you've done it! Come here. I want to thank you face to face.
Tribute - you mean you want to join the Raiders?
Trick's won't work on me.
Trickery will not help.
Trickery!
Trickery!
Tricks can't save you now.
Tricks won't trip me.
Tricky stuff.
Tricky!
Tricky!
Tricky, tricky!
Tricky. 
Tried the trick on the Raiders, so I hear. And sealed his fate.
Tried to. Not sure what good it did.
Trifling maneuver.
Trigger finger's itchy!
Trigger happy, are we?
Trigger happy, are we?
Trill woo!
Trill!
Trilla.
Trivial opposition.
Trivial!
Trivial!
Trivial.
Trooper, I do not care.
Trooper, focus! You cannot lose your nerve when a Jedi attacks.
Trooper, there are worse punishments for insubordination than a poor deployment.
Trooper, you're late.
Troopers coming.
Troopers everywhere. Gotta be careful, BD.
Trophy hunters, they were, in search of the most rare catches.
Trouble always seems to find us, Greez. Haven't you learned that by now?
Trouble keeping up?
Trouble sticks around. Kind of like Turgle. Or blabbermouth scholars and their pointless questions.
Trouble, more trouble, and - you guessed it - a pain in the collective rear of everyone on this dusty rock.
Trouble, your name is Tina!
True growth occurs only after destruction.
True, but he'll never leave Koboh, and it's all you talk about.
True. Turgle told me he named a road after his foot.
True. You running any sabacc tables?
Truly, it seems, you are both boundless.
Truly? Then yes, I will return to the outpost at Rambler's Reach. We...had a domicile there.
Truly? Wasn't it marvelous?
Trust
Trust her.
Trust in Rayvis and his wisdom.
Trust in the Force, Padawan.
Trust in the Force.
Trust is irrelevant, only their use to me.
Trust me on that one.
Trust me, Greez, I'm not exactly thrilled to be here either.
Trust me, Monk. Better to play it safe.
Trust me, you won't miss it.
Trust them to do the right thing.
Trust yourself.
Truth hurts, metal man. Truth hurts.
Try Greez's 'umberhash!'
Try a real warrior!
Try again when you've got the pucks.

Trying something different.
Trying to be useful.
Trying to deal more damage.
Trying to find some quiet...
Trying to hide down there?
Trying to remember our patrol protocol. 
Trying to run, Jedi?
Trying to sneak down there?
Trying to survive? Hah.
Trying to wade across would be a bad idea.
Trying to. But we can't get a straight answer outta this one.
Tryna impress me?
Tsk tsk.
Tulakt knows this.
Tulakt with an excellent play!
Tulakt's gone.
Tulakt, always having 'visions of the future'.
Tulakt.
Tulakt.
Tulakt. Surprisingly strong!
Tulli comes out on top! Powerful play.
Tulli is very clearly playing for keeps!
Tulli with a clean takedown!
Tunnels are clear! The hangar should be up ahead. Move out!
Turbo Dogs! How much do I earn?
Turgle didn't have anything to do with Zee's kidnapping.
Turgle on a credit.
Turgle owes a small fortune, but I wouldn't exactly call it outstanding.
Turgle seizes the opening and retreats off-screen.
Turgle steps in from the periphery, accompanied by a warm, heavyset alien who introduces herself as Doma Dendra,
Turgle takes one down!
Turgle with a clean takedown, can you believe it!?
Turgle! Get over here.
Turgle, at some point, I might need you to vacate your spot at the bar.
Turgle, that was some nasty business with the Raiders.
Turgle, that's the one. He'll drink anything!
Turgle, what'll it take to stop your caterwauling?
Turgle, you ain't got no teeth.
Turgle.
Turgle: smarter than he looks!
Turgle? No can do. We need all the business we can get.
Turn back or die.
Turn it up, Deedee. Let's see if we can get some heads nodding around here...
Turned it into an Empire.
Turned to scrap
Turnin' up the heat!
Turnin' up the heat!
Turning up the heat!
Turns out our skills go pretty okay together, huh?
Turns out that sub-species of Poolio blossom only grows in the wild.
Turns out very smart. He immediately arrested me, smacked my head with the scrap.
Twakuhka: incinerated juggling thermal detonators.
Twee!
Twenty credits for that blaster!
Twenty cycles ago, I heard this town was nothing but a few shacks.
Twenty questions. I'm thinking of something, anything in the whole galaxy-
Twice the arms, twice the fun, right?
Twice the blades, twice the fun.
Twins threw him down a mine shaft. Friends ever since.
Twins, bolla!
Twins, get Cal across that gap.
Twins, yacht's all yours!
Twins, you ready to go?
Two beams, wrapped around the yacht. Gonna take a lotta torque.
Two centuries later and Master Khri's last directive still rattles my memory banks.
Two centuries, to be more precise.
Two choices - kill it, or die!
Two fewer tyrants for the galaxy to worry about, now.
Two hundred years and counting...
Two hundred years later, and this tech's still working. Let's see what's inside.
Two thousand credits, give or take.
Two to the chest. One to the head.
Two warriors at the height of their power, bound in brotherhood!
Two: one to call for help, one to translate.
Typical.
U-u-unless it was Rayvis. In which case, well... Obviously.
U-u-up there! There!
U-understood.
U-up there!
Uba sko!
Udee draa! Udee!
Ugh - BD, count yourself lucky you can't smell.
Ugh - too fast. 
Ugh a bramlik.
Ugh the smell.
Ugh why do we have to do these patrols.
Ugh!
Ugh!

Ugh! I... I'm trapped!
Ugh! No more close quarters support!
Ugh! What was that?
Ugh! You scum!
Ugh, Cal! So glad you're back. You missed all the action.
Ugh, I can't let him get away. 
Ugh, I hate these things.
Ugh, I needed those clankers...
Ugh, Mosey said she'd take care of 'em!
Ugh, a vile act to that BX.
Ugh, another easy kill.
Ugh, burnt feathers.
Ugh, get away!
Ugh, impossible!
Ugh, nothin'.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh. Back on patrol duty.
Ugh. I see you down there.
Ugh. My boots are always a little loose. 
Ugh. Nasty customers. Armed to the teeth with sliced battle droids for backup.
Ugh. Quite.
Ugh. That thing...sheds.
Ugh. The smell down here is...potent.
Ugh. This planet...
Ugh. You'll pay!
Ugly?! Hah! You'd be a stain on my boot if those blasted hunters hadn't got my leg...
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Uh huh. 
Uh huh. 
Uh huh. I bet you would, killer!
Uh huh. Never heard that one before. First tip: expand ya arsenal.
Uh huh. Remind me who crashed the Mantis into Dredger Gorge?
Uh oh! Someone's armed.
Uh oh, it looks mad
Uh oh.
Uh oh.
Uh oh.
Uh oh. 
Uh oh. BD?
Uh oh. I'm gonna need cover. 
Uh oh. Just me now. 
Uh oh...
Uh ooohhh!
Uh, I don't think we've met...
Uh, I think he just took out our last rocket trooper. Not really sure. 
Uh, I think they're about to blow a gasket.
Uh, I'm trying to keep a low profile here.
Uh, Kata, what are you doing there?
Uh, Zee.
Uh, actually, the Mantis has been drifting a bit. I think I need to tune that stabilizer.
Uh, cable's a bit frayed. Not in bad shape. Should be a quick patch job.
Uh, fine...
Uh, glory's okay, I guess...
Uh, hey.
Uh, is that gorger coming towards us?
Uh, is that thing dangerous?
Uh, let me think. I've never fought one, I've never seen one, and I don't know what a lightsaber is.
Uh, maybe? On the Shattered Moon.
Uh, no thanks.
Uh, no thanks.
Uh, no.
Uh, no.
Uh, no. BD?
Uh, not sure. You wanna try?
Uh, not with you?
Uh, ok.
Uh, okay.
Uh, okay.
Uh, okay. Y-you'll never beat me!
Uh, okay...how many fish does it take to teach a class?
Uh, okay...how many protocol droids does it take to repair a power link?
Uh, right. 'For the cause'.
Uh, s-sir?
Uh, sir?
Uh, that was our last droid. Guess it's my turn. 
Uh, that's a Jedi!
Uh, we got a big bug over here.
Uh, we have reports of a Jedi in the area? Should I be concerned?
Uh, who do you think would win an arm wrestling match? You or me?
Uh, yeah. An honor, that's it...
Uh, yeah. Totally adequate.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. I'm done poundin' sand - reckon we're ready for a big score.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh. Amazing, you should've come.
Uh. Roger, roger.
Uh. What are we doing here again?
Uh. Yeah, hi. Is Cere there?
Uh. Yeah. I guess so.
Uh... sir? Are you okay?
Uh... yeah.
Uh... yes, sir. We removed all of the natives. And there haven't been any surprises. Isn't that good?
Uh... you get a new tool belt?
Uh...it's complicated. But we'll find it.
Uh...sure. What do you want to know?
Uhh, I don't think that was me?
Uhh, but I'm the commander. I should be directing from the rear. Right?
Uhh, hold it, hold it!
Uhh, not now.
Uhh, r-roger, roger?
Uhh, roger roger.
Uhh.
Uhhh, fire!
Uhhh, of course, uhh, yes. Unless...
Uhhh.
Uhhh... what?
Uhhhh, what?
Uhntz uhntz buh-bap!
Um, alright.
Ummm, following protocol.
Umph!

Very good. Our masks protect us from the sands, from raw winds -
Very good. Proceed with your stratagem.
Very good. Yeah, the Second Sister tried to compliment me but I was too busy fighting.
Very interesting.
Very kind of you. That said, I'm afraid this one has sentimental value.
Very kind, but first chance we get, I'm making you a plate of Great Granny Pyloon's Umberhash!

Wait 'til Greez hears about this. Right on his doorstep.
Wait - no. Never mind!
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Another one? Cal, you have a very bad habit of picking up strays.
Wait around all you want.
Wait for the Jedi, then eliminate with extreme prejudice.
Wait noooooo!
Wait until executive committee hears about this.
Wait until the others hear about this.
Wait until the others hear about this.

Wait, do you hear that?
Wait, do you hear that?
Wait, do you hear that?
Wait, do you...have feelings for Mosey?
Wait, he can do that?
Wait, he's dead?
Wait, if we burn it all down, won't we burn ourselves up too?
Wait, no, don't leave me out here!
Wait, no: Moran, don't engage.
Wait, she's sending someone else?
Wait, there are enemies around here?
Wait, there was an accident? What are my orders!
Wait, wait.
Wait, whaaaAAAH!
Wait, what was that?
Wait, what's--no!
Wait, what?
Wait, what? Merrin's joining us?
Wait, what?! Do you have a death wish or something?
Wait, where are you going?
Wait, where's the lousy droid?
Wait, why did you all die?
Wait, you're friends with a Nightsister?
Wait, you're getting paid?
Wait, you're not a raider.
Wait. You destroyed him!
Wait...what?! The shield is down!
Wait? Where'd you go?
Waited a long time for this bounty. Long time.
Waiting for a gap in the patrols. I'm taking the antiquities from this wayhouse cache.
Waiting for me?
Waiting, watching, always watching. I keep guard - lucky you, right?
Waiting.
Wake up. He's here!
Wake up. We've got a job to do.
Walk away.
Walk away.
Walk in wisdom.
Walk it off!
Walk it off.
Walk softly. The enemy will hear us coming miles away.

Wan'yek Whett an' his vile crew, surrounded by glumbrig eels - spearin' 'em with their harpoons!

Want a ride?
Want another?
Want more?
Want some more?

Want to check it out?
Want to join your friends?

Wanted to get that off my hands.
Wanting more doesn't always mean you're greedy. It just means you'd like to grow.
War's expensive. Someone's got to pay for it.
Warmest regards!

Wars aren't won by asking permission.
Was I seeing things?
Was Rambler's Reach peaceful when you came here?
Was Tendo sharp? No. Bloody idiot. Was he a looker? Well, people looked alright. Fella was uglier than a shiverpede.
Was it hard to talk Greez out of retirement?
Was it hours? Years? Och, neither would faze me.
Was it...too easy for you?
Was it?
Was that a compliment?
Was that a person?
Was that a warning shot?

Was there fear in their voices?
Was this in training?
Wasn't as easy as we hoped it would be.
Wasn't exactly the welcome party I was looking for.
Wasn't expecting this. 
Wasn't it obvious? Angling for a better look at that High Republic chamber!
Wasn't me.
Wasn't planning on it.
Wasn't so bad. There were zombies, Cal! Zombies.

Waterfall?! In my day, the boldest Jedi used to cliff dive!
Way ahead of you.
Way of the world, Leo. Rather you in the ground peaceful then someone's dinner.
Way out of here is blocked by Koboh matter. Is there an orb around here?
Way to bring Ashe to town. Best tunes in Pyloon's!
Way too close.
Way's clear, Cal. Just be careful.
Way's clear. Not bad.
We Narkis might say that the two of you are united by a concordant thread.
We accomplished our goal.
We actually won? Really?
We agreed on monthly, my pungent friend. But listen: an old associate might be paying me a visit.
We ain't throwin' everything away just 'cause things got a little hairy.
We all believe in you.
We all earned this one today. 
We all know it's a rigged game.
We all must do our part, Padawan, no matter our place.
We all must obey, from the greatest admiral to the lowest stormtrooper.
We all need sustenance. Well, none for you, obviously.
We all shared in the spoils. So much priorite, the whole bloody outpost didn't have to work for a month!
We already checked out the caverns. You were right - they're not safe at all.
We always feared that he had died.
We always prevail.
We appear to have no more close-range support.
We are agreed.
We are alone now.
We are arranging a meeting. Turns out there are more people ready to take action than we thought.
We are being fired on.
We are compatible patrolling together.
We are done here, Jedi. Hope we never meet again.
We are down a destroyer droid!
We are far below. Did you close your eyes when we were in the tunnels?
We are ghosts, prowling hallways of death.
We are grateful for all that you do.
We are grateful that Lord Vader has shown an interest in our operations.
We are in danger.
We are in your debt!
We are in your debt, noble one.
We are lacking B2 units.
We are losing sentry droids.
We are not alike.
We are not done yet!
We are not done.
We are not equals.
We are not here to engage in commerce.
We are not so different, then.
We are out of B2s!
We are out of fire support.
We are over here.
We are programmed for combat, clandestine infiltration and assassination.
We are programmed to kill enemies. What else is required?
We are provided with whatever weapons are required to complete our task.
We are safe. I kept us hidden on approach.
We are statistically likely to be ambushed in narrow passes.
We are stronger than this creature!
We are taller than raiders.
We are the Imperial Security Bureau.
We are the Narkis Anchorites. We study and venerate the Force as it manifests through knowledge.
We are the eyes of the Empire.
We are too strong for him.
We are true assets to the Empire.
We are under attack. Deploy the garrison!
We are waiting.
We are wasting time. Let's return to the Mantis and hunt down Bode.
We asked for it. Shade from that oppressive Koboh sun!
We barely escaped Coruscant, Greez. Wish I'd had you by my side.
We barely won...
We began our work in the Holy City of NiJedha, preserving whatever we could find of the Jedi tradition.
We believe Koboh matter originates from deep within the Abyss.
We best get this over with.
We best get those power cells looked at when we get back to base.
We better bring these to the garden.
We better buck up if he can do that.
We better check that out.
We better end this fast.
We better get after him. 
We better get this back to Caij.
We better get this back to the archive.
We better. I expected more from a Force-user.
We both have our roles to play in this struggle.
We both know what happens when I stay in one place too long.
We both might hate change, but we've seen enough to know it's just the natural flow of life.
We build something new.
We came across a tibidee. Ever seen one?
We came all this way, never went on a grocery run.
We came to this rock together, we were supposed to leave together.
We can call the lift with that terminal.
We can catch him still.
We can do better.
We can do both.
We can do this easy, or hard...
We can do this!
We can do this.
We can expect no less from Bode.
We can get him!
We can handle it here.
We can hope.
We can make this quick!
We can manage.
We can no longer rely on Viper droids.
We can only hope Dagan feels it too.
We can pin him.
We can play this game all day.
We can reach the top now.
We can rest there.
We can still see you. 
We can still take him.
We can still take it down!
We can strike before reinforcements arrive.
We can take it!
We can take the position if we move quietly.
We can take this Jedi.
We can take this gorocco, no problem!
We can take those things too.
We can talk a little later.
We can talk later.
We can trade this at Doma's shop.
We can use that terminal to rotate the billboard.
We can't all be winners.
We can't do anything but wait until he's here.
We can't fight that!
We can't keep this up!
We can't keep this up.
We can't lead them back to the Archive.
We can't let any more threats like him through.
We can't let her down.
We can't let him escape again.
We can't let him escape!
We can't let him escape.
We can't let him get away. 
We can't lose, can we?
We can't relent!
We can't stop him!
We can't stop him!
We can't stop him! The Jedi took out a flametrooper!
We can't win if he keeps recovering.
We can't win this...
We can't win without flametrooper support...
We cannot be stopped!
We cannot lose another unit.
We cannot trust him, not after what he's done.
We cannot.
We cannot.
We caught him!
We caught him!
We caught one as he tried to escape.
We caught you!
We checked it out already.
We could always ask Koob and Lizz to see whether the senator can fly.
We could build something different. Something better.
We could disrupt communication, sabotage their supply lines...
We could have hunted him with a guild tracker.
We could optimize our patrol route efficiency by changing postings less frequently.
We could set it on fire? You know, to pass the time.
We could use a real pilot.
We couldn't save Armias.
We crossed paths. It's not lurking anymore.
We descended to the mines. But when my back was turned, they fled.
We did it!
We did it, Bode.
We did it.
We did not train for this.
We did.
We did. Been a long time since I've seen her.
We did. Hope that's alright.
We didn't train for this!
We do it for the glory of the Empire. There is no higher calling.
We do not experience fear.
We do not need droids.
We doing this or what, Cal?
We doing this or what?
We don't even have to try here.
We don't have any more flametroopers. 
We don't have much to worry about here.
We don't have to worry about that anymore.
We don't hear much between jobs. He plays things close to the chest.
We don't know the Mantis like you do. Nobody does.
We don't like you.
We don't mess with that black market gear.
We don't need Probes to take you down.
We don't need Viper droids to take you down.
We don't need droid support!
We don't need droids to take you down!
We don't need droids.
We don't need flamethrowers.
We don't stand a chance against that Jedi -
We don't stand a chance.
We eagerly await your arrival. However, a dust storm is sweeping over our location.
We enjoy watching organics suffer.
We fall in love. In love with Koboh. You're one of us now.
We fight for Rayvis.
We fight for the glory of the Empire's ideals, never forget that.
We find the Jedi and shoot the Jedi. Our orders are very simple.
We finished the gunners.
We fought for that together -
We fought side by side until the Jedi betrayed him.
We found each other on Bogano. He used to belong to a Jedi Master that I was looking for.
We found it, Master Cordova.
We found ourselves afield of the Perlemian Trade Route. As soon as the captain took his hand off the yoke...
We found this abandoned monastery and set about building everything you see.
We gather knowledge much like other scholars, yes.
We get it - a lot went down while she was asleep.
We get what we need?
We gettin' rid of these things or what?
We go way back! How 'bout we bring in this Jedi together? Split the bounty right down the middle.
We go.
We going to Jedha or what?
We got a Force user!
We got a Jedi lurking.
We got a Jedi!
We got a big one here!
We got a bilemaw here!
We got a fight ahead, Cal. I'm game if you are.
We got a fight ahead, Cal. I'm game if you are.
We got a fight on our hands!
We got a gorocco.
We got a maverick!
We got a new prospector here!
We got a plan for the senator?
We got a rancor.
We got a real wild one here.
We got a runner!
We got a shiverpede here!
We got a skriton, I said a skriton!
We got a threat with a laser sword here.
We got ambushed by the Raiders. I ran.
We got an angry one here!
We got company again.
We got company.
We got him!
We got him!
We got him!
We got him. 
We got it?
We got laws around here.
We got lucky with this one!
We got no Bode.
We got no compass.
We got no hope! Zero! Zilch! Nothing! How you doing BD?
We got no more range trooper power!
We got one down here!
We got one less droideka.
We got one!
We got ourselves a Jedi!
We got some seeds. Wonder if they'll grow in our garden.
We got stims here!
We got their flamethrowers!
We got to stay on 'em. 
We got you, Cal. Hit up DD-EC if you wanna hear anything specific.
We gotta be no-nonsense, efficient. Kill the Jedi, secure our homes.
We gotta find that yacht before the Empire does.
We gotta get 'em while they're distracted!
We gotta get out of here before the hammer drops.
We gotta get to that yacht.
We gotta get up there. Any ideas?
We gotta go somewhere.
We gotta go, BD.
We gotta go.
We gotta help them, for Cere.
We gotta keep moving, buddy.
We gotta kill this thing!
We gotta take her out.
We gotta take this storm head on.
We had a common enemy, Caij. You.
We had a few close calls here and there. But I took care of it.
We had a fight, but...
We have a Jedi on-planet.
We have a bisected droid here!
We have a bramlik here.
We have a containment breach!
We have a droideka down.
We have a hostile bramlik!
We have a mogu here!
We have a problem here.
We have a responsibility now to prepare Tanalorr for the Path. That must be our focus, Cal.
We have a saying for such times: 'Ever it passes'.
We have a saying from when I'm from.
We have a very angry bird here.
We have a winner! Spectacular plays by Cal!
We have almost reached 'Pilgrim's Crossing.'
We have already swept this area four times.
We have an enemy to fight. And we will win.
We have an intruder.
We have been trapped down here for at least a standard cycle, maybe more.
We have both been through so much. But we must persevere, Cal! After all...
We have defeated him. 
We have gained the advantage.
We have inbound!
We have incoming!

We have our orders. Do it again.
We have our orders. Let's move out.
We have our orders. Maintain protocol.
We have our orders: eliminate the Jedi. I will fulfill our orders: I will eliminate the Jedi.
We have our target, now let's reach it.
We have ourselves a temper tantrum here!
We have reached a crossroads. Night falls, but will the sun again rise?
We have reports of a Jedi. I will seek and destroy.
We have some sort of annoyance.
We have some tunes, but there's gotta be so much left.
We have the advantage.
We have the advantage.
We have the advantage. We are many, the Jedi is one.
We have the tactical advantage.

We have to get you up there.
We have to get you up there.
We have to hold the hangar until evacuations are complete.
We have to hurry!

We have to rescue her. Once he gets what he wants he'll scrap her for sure.
We have to secure the area.
We have to stop him!
We have to stop him!
We have to stop him.

We have to stop the Jedi here. We can't let them hurt anyone else.
We have to take him down quick.
We have to win.
We have training for a reason. 
We have you now.
We have you!
We have.
We head to the hangar and leave Coruscant.
We helped each other. That's how we made it out alive.
We just can't stop him!
We just have to beat Dagan and the Raiders to it.
We just have to do our duty to the Empire!
We just need to find a way through here.
We just need to keep firing on it.
We just need to stay focused, then we'll be the legends!
We just started walking an hour ago.
We killed a Jedi.
We killed it?
We killed it?
We knew one day the Empire would come. Just not so soon.
We knew you'd run.
We know the feeling.
We know what it's like to grow up alone.
We know what that's like.
We know what we have to do. Just gotta get it done.
We know what we must do.
We lit them up.
We live and learn, right buddy?
We lost a B1!
We lost a B2!
We lost a B2.
We lost a Destroyer Droid.
We lost a Destroyer!
We lost a droideka!
We lost a roller droid!

We lost him.
We lost him. 
We lost him. 
We lost our sentry droids.
We lost the commando droids.
We lost, haven't we?
We made it, BD!
We made it.
We made it. And I've got the compass.
We make a good team.
We make a stand?
We may not have a chance, but we do have loyalty to the Empire. 
We meet again, Jedi.
We meet again.
We meet again.
We might be able to hitch a ride.
We might be able to kill him.
We might be able use that crane to get across the bridge.
We might be in trouble...
We might have company. 
We might win.
We must adapt.
We must all do our duty in service to the greater cause.
We must attack. 
We must be constantly ready for the enemy Jedi.
We must be out of range.
We must catch him.
We must coordinate our efforts.
We must deliver the contact codes to Cere.
We must destroy those walkers.
We must find the remaining Anchorites. We will need them to make Tanalorr our own.
We must get to the other side.
We must keep moving.
We must keep moving.
We must keep our foes off-balance. Predictability is our true enemy.
We must locate the remaining Anchorites and bring them here.
We must not fail them like the many others before us.
We must remain vigilant in our search!
We must stop him!
We mustn't keep Cere waiting.
We nail a Jedi, the senator will be in our debt.
We need more reinforcements!
We need more troopers.
We need reinforcements.
We need reinforcements. We're not ready for an attack.
We need that.
We need the tuner back. It gives them access to everything Khri locked down.
We need to be wary of this one.
We need to call in our report.
We need to cross this gap.
We need to end this.
We need to find another Jedi. 
We need to find the Jedi!

We need to stop him.
We need to switch to ranged tactics.
We need to take it down!
We need to take them down before more arrive.
We need to use this.
We need to wait for the proper scanning crew.
We need you, Cere.
We need your help in identifying dissidents and insurgents.
We needed that B2 unit.
We needed those heavy droids!
We needed those!
We never forget a mark. Besides, your little stunt at the arena left more than just a pile of bodies and bruised egos.
We never talk.
We no longer have close quarters support!
We once had a feral caniphant terrorizing the ranch, just a menace. Destroyed our barn. Twice.
We once had a fire juggler come in. People paid to see her. Fifty credits a pop.
We own this place. These beasts don't.
We passed risky a while back.
We pledge ours to you.
We plummeted down tae the ocean, sundering the Grapnel on the sea floor...
We predicted this.
We press on!
We protected the children on that list. But there are others.
We provide safe passage and new identities to those who have been persecuted by the Empire.
We ran across it on our travels.
We ran into Merrin. Hadn't seen her in years.
We really should resupply when we're on Koboh.
We really took the fight to those Raiders. How you feeling?
We reversed our vaporators, pumped the air full of moisture.
We rigged her sublights, remember? You could hear the explosion from orbit!
We salvaged starship wreckage. Mostly capital ships from the Clone Wars.
We saw it, in our travels.
We see you.
We seek a dangerous fugitive.
We seek strength.
We seek universal truth, Brother.
We seem to lack any ranged units!
We serve Rayvis, as he serves Dagan.
We serve the Raiders.
We shall continue later.
We shall control this valley.
We shall end you!
We shall hunt you down!
We shall run you down.
We shall see.
We share a purpose. The Empire destroyed my home. All I have is what little wisdom I possess.
We should attack, now.
We should be able to ride the updraft to the far side now.
We should be apprised. We're all on the same side.
We should be careful.
We should be getting pretty close.
We should be manning our posts, not chasing rumors.
We should be ready to engage in case you miss.
We should be. Those skriton can't move through rock.
We should bring this to the Anchorites.
We should burn them.
We should celebrate!
We should chase him.
We should check on that.
We should check this out.
We should conduct training drills for the infantry.
We should duel sometime.
We should enjoy the lights while we can.
We should enjoy the lights while we can.
We should find more seeds for the garden.
We should fire warning shots, you know, to scare anyone nearby.
We should focus our fire on the Jedi now!
We should follow him down there. Right?
We should get Moogan tea together.
We should get out of here.
We should get these back to Cordova.
We should go back to Jedha soon. Cere and Cordova are waiting.
We should go into the droid business together.
We should go.
We should have long sticks.
We should help.
We should hurry.
We should inform the other squads.
We should join Greez. He's been talking to himself. More than usual.
We should keep moving.
We should keep our photoreceptors peeled for hostiles.
We should know our escape plan. Just in case.
We should look for higher elevation to get a better scan.
We should make sure it's dead!
We should move.
We should never have made this journey.
We should not delay. The Empire is threatening Pilgrim's Sanctuary.
We should not stay idle.
We should not take Pilgrim's Path to Cere's base.
We should plant these seeds in the garden. Pili will love it.
We should plant these seeds. Curious what Pili knows.
We should probably get moving as soon as we finish up -
We should probably get moving. How about checking in on Koboh?
We should return to Koboh soon.
We should send word, let them know we spotted him.
We should show this to Caij.
We should speak.
We should start a fire, right here. To, you know, keep us warm.
We should stay on the move.
We should switch to ranged only tactics. 
We should take these seeds back to the garden.
We should take this back to Jedha. Master Cordova will want to see what we found.
We should tidy up before we visit Greez.
We should use it for the Hidden Path.
We shouldn't be bringing her to a place like this.
We shouldn't even be out here.
We shouldn't have left her at the outpost.
We shouldn't stay here long.
We shouldn't. It's a patrol, not an assault.
We sneer at you!
We spotted two more patrols on the ridge.
We stand guard while Dagan gets the compass.
We still have a chance to help a lot of people. Despite everything, our goal is very near.
We still have the numbers!
We suffer the cycle of the Force of Others. Ever it passes.
We sure ain't.
We swam out o' the riven hull an' found ourselves surrounded by Quarren
We tend to write ourselves onto our machines. They can represent the best or the worst of us.
We think the intruder wasn't acting alone.
We took care of them. Maybe you should leave before more come.
We took down every gunner!
We took it out.
We took off and started our own thing. Rest of the outfit ended up dead or imprisoned.
We took out their rocket support!
We took some hits back there.
We tried. Honest.
We understand.
We understand.
We watch out for each other. Besides, Saw Gerrera doesn't settle for any less than the best.
We went through a lot on Coruscant. Even outside of the credits, he's stuck through it.
We were invaded.
We were just exploring. How long have you been here?
We were not trained for this!
We were on Coruscant, gathering intel for Saw Gerrera. Things got bad. Only two of us made it out.
We were one of the first people here, and both tried scouting for priorite.
We were out looking for the biggest, strongest beasts to fight each other, winner take all!
We were reprogrammed by Rayvis himself.
We were so close to a second chance.
We were trained well by the best. We will succeed. 
We were using those destroyers!
We weren't done.
We weren't supposed to fight your war, Jedi. But we're paying your price. I'm not going to go the way of Armias.
We weren't trained against sabers!
We will be heroes!
We will be ready for any intruders on our territory.
We will be ready for him.
We will be safe here, for a time.
We will be victorious.
We will blast any Jedi slime apart.
We will break you.
We will build something that can outlast the Empire, I promise you that. I promise.
We will capture you, traitor!
We will continue to demonstrate that this bureau is indispensable to the Empire!
We will continue your legacy, Cere.
We will crush that festering Jedi maggot.
We will defeat him.
We will defeat the Jedi.
We will defeat the Jedi. He cannot escape us - he will not.
We will defeat you.
We will defeat you. 
We will destroy them all!
We will drop you off.
We will end this.
We will end you. 
We will find out together!
We will find out.
We will find the enemy and eliminate them.
We will find you.
We will follow where she leads.
We will get you.
We will make an example of this traitor.
We will make it worth your while!
We will need to prepare ourselves. Greez will make us lunch.
We will not be hobbled!
We will not ship with this.
We will pursue you.
We will see who reaps the greater rewards in the end.
We will shelter in Cere's base. It is hidden from the Empire in the high desert.
We will still defeat you. 
We will still win.
We will stop this.
We will stop you.
We will subdue this planet.
We will take down all enemies in the name of the Bedlam Raiders.
We will take this beast down.
We will tear this world down, piece by piece.
We will watch it burn.
We will wipe out all traitors!
We won't be crushed!
We won't be long.
We won't be routed.
We won't fare well without rocket troopers. 
We won't forget them.
We won't let anything happen to you, will we, BD?
We won't survive much longer...
We won't win at this rate.
We won't.
We won't.
We would rule this entire planet.
We wouldn't dream of it. Doma's done a lot for us.
We wouldn't have gotten this far without you, Zee.
We'd better be careful with those things.
We'd better keep moving then.
We'd better.
We'd lived our whole lives in cities, factories, nightclubs. It was time to explore a more organic sound.
We'd, uh, appreciate if you kept this quiet.
We'll accomplish more if we split up. I'll stay here and give Cordova a hand.
We'll all be okay, Greez.
We'll always find you. 
We'll be back soon.
We'll be commanding our own squads in no time.
We'll be commended for sure!
We'll be fine. Try to get eyes on Dagan.
We'll be okay though, right?
We'll be right behind you.
We'll be sure to take a look.
We'll be waitin' for ya, kid!
We'll be waiting, Cal.
We'll be waiting.
We'll beat you. 
We'll bleed you dry. 
We'll break camp at first light.
We'll break your guard.
We'll build the temple here.
We'll call it a business expense.
We'll catch 'em later.
We'll catch you Jedi!
We'll catch you. Eventually.
We'll check it out.
We'll check it out.
We'll check that out next.
We'll clear this up shortly.
We'll crack him!
We'll debrief later.
We'll defeat you.
We'll do our duty!
We'll do this together.
We'll end this quick, 
We'll eradicate every fool who thought they could delay our occupation.
We'll escape before their main force arrives.
We'll fight together.
We'll figure it out.
We'll find Brother Armias.
We'll find him.
We'll find our own way.
We'll find out, sooner or later.
We'll find the proper place to bury 'em soon.
We'll find you again!
We'll find you!
We'll find you!
We'll find you. 
We'll find you. You know that, right?
We'll get Zee back, Toa. You have my word.
We'll get around faster, now.
We'll get back on its trail soon enough.
We'll get back on its trail soon enough.
We'll get through. 
We'll get you for that!
We'll get you!
We'll get you, Jedi!
We'll get you. 
We'll get you. 
We'll get you. 
We'll glide down there!
We'll go together, I cannot let you take the risk alone.
We'll have to find another way around.
We'll have to invite a member of the Jedi Council to visit in person.
We'll head back soon. Don't worry about us.
We'll head there as soon as we can.
We'll head there next.
We'll head there soon. Just want to make sure we're ready.
We'll keep our eyes on the prize.
We'll keep that in mind.
We'll keep your secret safe, Cal.
We'll kill all of you.
We'll learn from the mistakes of the past.
We'll let you know if we decide to leave.
We'll let you know if we do.
We'll make do with what we've got.
We'll make you pay!
We'll manage.
We'll meet again, Jedi!
We'll meet again.
We'll mourn later, gotta keep moving.
We'll need some extra speed to make that jump.
We'll need some living space. Homes.
We'll need to create our own door out of here.
We'll need to dispose of the body.
We'll need to get to the upper level.
We'll never forget. But that's how they're still with us.
We'll post up here, wait for reinforcements. Alert central command.
We'll put these in the ground next time we're at the garden.
We'll root you all out. 
We'll see about 'em. Sooner or later.
We'll see about getting you an oil bath when this is over.
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.
We'll see him again. 
We'll see if the senator's got any food on that yacht.
We'll see who surprises who.
We'll see you back at the cantina, perhaps. After this ordeal, I know I could use a refreshment.
We'll see, Turgle.
We'll see, sport. We'll see. I'm the type to leave the past...in the past.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see. Boss is looking for something. Find it, or we'll find you.
We'll see. Greez set the bar pretty high.
We'll see. He might not want to take the risk.
We'll see. Watch your step, Jedi.
We'll see. Weeee'll see.
We'll settle up.
We'll show them to fear the Raiders!
We'll soon fix that then.
We'll speak later.
We'll speak later. Go on, set forth!
We'll speak once you've taken care of that dangerous specimen!
We'll split up here.
We'll still kill you.
We'll stop you!
We'll stop you.
We'll strike you all down!
We'll take 'em down.
We'll take a look, thank you.
We'll take a look, thank you.
We'll take him down easy.
We'll take him down together.
We'll take them together!
We'll take you down!
We'll take you down, face-to-face.
We'll take you down.
We'll talk later, Cal.
We'll talk later, alright?
We'll talk later.
We'll talk later.
We'll talk more later.
We'll talk some other time.
We'll talk soon.
We'll talk soon.
We'll try. Thanks.
We'll vanquish you!
We'll win easy.
We'll wipe out all traitors.
We'll wipe them all out. 
We'll...get a hero's funeral?
We're Koboh-bound.
We're a part of a network,
We're about to drop out of hyperspace. Sit down. 
We're about to get paid. 
We're all doomed!
We're all friends here. I can trust you.
We're all gonna end up scrap and it'll be your fault.
We're all in on you, buddy.
We're all out of Viper Droids.
We're all out of close combat units. 
We're all out of flametrooper support!
We're all out of rocket support now. 
We're all that's left.
We're all together! Ha!
We're almost there.
We're almost there.
We're almost there. Get ready for landing.
We're alone now, Jedi. 
We're always fine.
We're arriving at Jedha.
We're at the moon. Grab some seat.
We're better than him, right?
We're citizens, you can't treat us like this.
We're clear.
We're close to finishing this, one way or another.
We're close. Hope you saved some for Dagan.
We're closer than ever to giving the people we love real safety.
We're comin' up on Koboh.
We're dead meat if we don't find our way out of here.
We're definitely getting closer.
We're doomed without a flametrooper. 
We're doomed!
We're doomed, you know it, I know it.
We're down a B2 unit. 
We're getting a signal from Jedha.
We're getting close.
We're getting quite the green thumb, huh BD.
We're getting there!
We're getting to work with Purge Troopers!
We're going through you.
We're going to be killed!
We're going to have trouble without flametrooper support. 
We're going to take a beating without rocket troopers. 
We're gonna ask him to give it back.
We're gonna be friends, aren't we, girl?
We're gonna die here, aren't we?
We're gonna die on this rock.
We're gonna get wiped out!
We're gonna help you.
We're gonna make you pay.
We're gonna take you out!
We're headed for the nearest outpost, how far is it?
We're headin' up the mountain, what do you know about it?
We're heading to the Abyss now.
We're here to lock the area down, not ask questions.
We're here to protect you. I'm sure that's worth a few more credits.
We're here to work together. Don't doubt the power of a Jedi.
We're here with a purpose - cause some trouble.
We're here, Cal. Park it.
We're his family, now. You can tell by how much he complains.
We're in for it now...
We're in pursuit!
We're in the lair o' the Fantailed Laa fish: the greatest smeller-o'-things-foul beyond the Deep Core!
We're in their sights.
We're in this together.
We're in this together. You want something, you pay your share.
We're in trouble.
We're in trouble. That was our last heavy gunner.
We're just glad you're okay.
We're just looking around.
We're just passing through fellas.
We're keeping our photoreceptors open for trespassers, blockhead.
We're lacking close-range specialists.
We're late, pick up the pace.
We're late.
We're living in Koboh's Golden Age!
We're locked out.
We're losing backup.
We're losing backup.
We're losing men!
We're losing men!
We're losing support here!
We're losing support here.
We're losing support!
We're losing troops!
We're losing units.
We're lucky, BD. It looks well-preserved.
We're managing.
We're missing a crate of munitions. You brought it, right?
We're more like partners.
We're nearly at the top.
We're next!
We're not a threat, just passing through.
We're not alone out here.
We're not alone.
We're not doing this.
We're not done yet.
We're not done yet.
We're not getting to Bode until we find that base commander.
We're not getting up this water. Not without some help.
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere, stormtrooper. We have our orders.
We're not going down easily.
We're not gonna make it to the hangar! Gotta put her down!
We're not on Jedha anymore.
We're not really the careful type.
We're not the only ones interested in the Array.
We're not the only ones looking for something here.
We're not through yet!
We're off to a good start.
We're off to a pretty good start here, buddy.
We're on high alert.
We're on our way.
We're on patrol, looking for enemies.
We're on patrol....like we do nearly every single day.
We're on to you, Jedi!
We're on, Kestis.
We're out of BX units!
We're out of Viper Droids!
We're out of Viper droid support!
We're out of battle droids!
We're out of close-range troops!
We're out of droid support!
We're out of droid support. 
We're out of droid support. Be careful. 
We're out of flamethrower support!
We're out of flamethrower support. 
We're out of flametrooper support.
We're out of flametroopers! Get! Him!
We're out of flametroopers...
We're out of gunners!
We're out of gunners. Watch yourselves. 
We're out of heavy artillery! 
We're out of heavy gunners!
We're out of heavy gunners!
We're out of probe droid support!
We're out of ranged support!
We're out of ranged troopers. Time to get personal.
We're out of ranged troops, what're we gonna do?!
We're out of rockets.
We're outgunned!
We're patrolling for enemies. Haven't you been listening?
We're programmed to obey.
We're protecting the galaxy here. Act like it.
We're ready when you are, Cal. Let's get a move on.
We're ready.
We're running low on backup here!
We're running low on water.
We're searching for a lost planet.
We're sinking! Gotta move!
We're soldiers in the Empire, we're on the same side.
We're spared from their rockets - for now.
We're still gonna beat you.
We're stretched thin as it is. Post up here and keep your eyes open.
We're stuck unless we can get through that gate.
We're supposed to beat that!?
We're taking a detour.
We're taking losses!
We're the Bedlam Raiders. Nobody invades our base and gets away with it.
We're thinking of headin' to Dredger Gorge. Ever been?
We're too exposed out here.
We're too late.
We're too much for him. 
We're too old and stuck in our ways to leave, is what we're saying!
We're totally out of close quarters stormtroopers.
We're totally out of flametroopers.
We're totally out of ranged units!
We're tougher than those things.
We're under attack!
We're under attack.
We're under attack? Here!?
We're vulnerable. 
We're wastin' time.
We've all got to fight the Empire however we can.
We've almost got him!
We've almost got him!
We've already been there, Turgle, but thanks for the tip.
We've already got an Emperor. Give us the compass.
We've been attacked. Evacuation protocols in order.
We've been going for so long, I could sleep for days.
We've been introduced. You okay, Greez?

We've seen it. Means they've got a lot of firepower.
We've seen it. Then they've got a lot of firepower.
We've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly.
We've seen this story before. I just didn't think we'd see it way out here on Koboh.

We've seen worse.
We've still got some fight in us!
We've trained for scenarios like this.

Welcome, young sage.
Welcome.
Welcome. I am Santari Khri, the director of this experimental facility.
Welcome. Let us light the past together.
Welcome. You've got foes waiting.
Well I do! This has gotta be for something.
Well I don't know. I got a reputation, I suppose. For being tough. Alert. Ready to do what needs to be done.
Well I hope your programmin' holds up, that's all.
Well I mean I guess I could have Monk keep his eye on the saloon.
Well I must say, boss, it's nice to hear you coming around on Zee.
Well I'll be!
Well I'm Cal.
Well I'm not sure I could do this without you.
Well I'm proud of you, Greez.
Well I...
Well ain't you a sight!
Well all I know is if the dead start walking around here, you're gonna get an earful.
Well aren't you a cute little droid.
Well aren't you a droid magnet.
Well aren't you fancy?
Well as soon as they do, I'll scout ahead and they can rest on the Mantis.
Well before you go charging in there like a mudhorn through a moisture farm, allow me to give you the lowdown.
Well blocked!
Well color me impressed.
Well congrats to you for using your initiative there. You chiffin' droids are a liability.
Well dodged!
Well dodged.
Well done - heavy gunners destroyed.
Well done - no more gunners!
Well done Rayvis.
Well done squad.
Well done!
Well done!
Well done!
Well done!
Well done! Then it's all over, is it?
Well done, Cal.
Well done, Jedi!
Well done, Jedi. Your perseverance will serve you well in the trials ahead.
Well done, Master!
Well done, Master!
Well done, what a show! Come here, my warrior friend!
Well done.
Well done.
Well done. 
Well done. Can't say I'm surprised. You and BD are tough customers.
Well done. Shall we continue?
Well done. You may find new opponents on your travels.
Well done. Your strategy proved superior.
Well even the Padawans sense something amiss...
Well for one, she conveniently seems to forget to clean her own dirty dishes.
Well fought! Glad I'm finally rubbing off on you...
Well fought, Cere!
Well fought, beast. You remind me of home, you know. Were you hungry?
Well fought, brother.
Well fought, but you are outmatched.
Well fought.
Well good! For starters, the Raiders are still out there causing trouble, leader or not.
Well he knows more than you, but that's not saying much.
Well hello BD! [laughs]
Well hello there.
Well hello! Come on in.
Well hello. It seems you've beaten all of these players. Is there someone else you can find?
Well her credits helped us get this place off the ground but she hasn't visited yet.
Well hey there Cal! Good to see ya!
Well hey there, traveler.
Well hey, Cal! Check out the wares.
Well hi.
Well if I told you, it wouldn't be a tell.
Well if you're going to teach younglings, you had better learn.
Well isn't that all any of us can do, right?
Well it doesn't speak highly of you to be so unaware of your surroundings.
Well it is very clear how much you care for the ship.
Well it looks like the Inquisitors missed one!
Well it will soon be put to the test, one way or another.
Well it's getting late, I'll go with you.
Well it's gonna be tough to take evasive maneuvers in the Mantis with a spatula.
Well it's good to see you too Greez.
Well let's find out.
Well listen to you, mister optimistic.
Well look at that! You've beaten all the competition...for now.
Well look at you! A shell. That's great.
Well look who it is!
Well make time, it's worth it! Trust me!
Well not on their lives. No such thing as a free lunch, let alone a free party. I don't care what the occasion is,
Well now that's a little violent.
Well now, that's a little insulting. But I'll allow it, because I like your energy.
Well now, you said it better than I could. Ain't nothin' gonna bring us down, nothin'.
Well out here on the frontier, only way we survive is by sticking together.
Well parried!
Well parried!
Well played, Greez. Very well played.
Well played.
Well played.
Well said, Zygg.
Well so much for them.
Well sounds like you're fired up and ready to do business of a different kind.
Well spotted.
Well spotted.
Well strike my stars! I guess miracles do happen.
Well struck!
Well struck, Jedi.
Well thank you for asking, I'm -
Well that last part's true, at least. Not much happens round here except the occasional gorocco mauling.
Well that was her recipe! Lovingly recreated by yours truly. You liked it, right?
Well that's that, I guess.
Well then - let's go stir up some trouble!
Well then, I bet everything will work out in the end.
Well then, have a wonderful day.
Well there go the heavy droids!
Well this is new!
Well timed.
Well we should play some time.
Well what do I know about drinks?
Well what do you think?
Well what have we here?
Well you don't have to worry about that, not back here.
Well you won't make a living talking to me. Unless you mean to rob me.
Well, 'crater' is putting it lightly.
Well, Dagan is certain that she left a compass for him to find.
Well, Greez clearly had the advantage there.
Well, I can help with that!
Well, I can put you together pretty fast, but a Jedi can take you apart even faster.
Well, I can wait.
Well, I certainly had some glorious years. I'm sure I never told you about the incident over Muunilinst?
Well, I could get another one if you think you might...wanna...
Well, I could go for some.
Well, I deserve something from Rayvis.
Well, I did spend a day on Bracca.
Well, I do at least. When I love something, I love it with all my heart.
Well, I don't know if I would, but I could...
Well, I don't think they fell through a hole in the roof every time, buddy.
Well, I found lover boy. I told Sorc if he ever moved against me, he'd never hear that sweet voice again.
Well, I guess that's why they call it hazard pay. Not much to be done, is there?
Well, I have just the thing to get you started.
Well, I have to finish packing.
Well, I hope it's worth all this effort.
Well, I just found out that the old man ate it tryin' to nick a fuel injector off Imperial turf.
Well, I knew you would come back.
Well, I like you two alright.
Well, I put together a few rough tracks.
Well, I suppose it's all over now, one way or another.
Well, I thought about it. I didn't actually say or do anything.
Well, I told an Imperial officer that I knew about a secret Priorite deposit.
Well, I was interrogated by the new leader of the Raiders.
Well, I was planning to replace those cushions...but maybe that can wait.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as calling it a 'plan', per se...
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Well, I'd say you have a purpose. Everyone here seems to be happier since you arrived.
Well, I'll be scopin' out the renovations up top. You should too.
Well, I'll have to drop by sometime and try it. Thanks, old friend.
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Well, I'm glad you're alright. We're lucky Turgle hasn't doomed us all by antagonizing the Raiders.
Well, I'm happy to let you go ahead and make all the mistakes you like.
Well, I'm no good with advice, but, uh...
Well, I've seen plenty of wild things in my time, but Jedi? They're mythical for a reason.
Well, Qui-Gon Jinn and I enjoyed a close friendship.
Well, Tendo fills his arms with the stuff - couldn't see the ground in front of him!
Well, [chuckle] lost that B2!
Well, actually she's a droid from the High Republic.
Well, ain't it the man who bested the mogu. That's right I heard!
Well, all things considered, this cantina and its denizens have been quite welcoming!
Well, alright.
Well, aren't you friendly?
Well, away with you! Nothing for you here!
Well, aye, the landing gear. But when her great jaws parted -
Well, better it runs away than runs us through.
Well, better it runs away than runs us through.
Well, but -
Well, clearly.
Well, do something?
Well, don't lose sleep over us. We can manage on our own.
Well, don't you have a silver tongue. Maybe I'll let ya take the Mantis for a swing sometime.
Well, fast as the morning thaw, I could tell somethin' was off. Wan'yek, he would nae look me in the eye.
Well, from the reports, troopers who maintain their blaster's integrity live twice as long.
Well, go on then.
Well, he left alright.
Well, he seems capable. Aren't you gonna introduce us?
Well, hello! Come for a victory lap?
Well, here we are, back where it all started.
Well, how do we sign up?
Well, if it ain't my co-conspirator - I mean, business partner.
Well, if it isn't Toa! I assumed you were raider chow by now! Hey, how goes the expedition?
Well, if it isn't my favorite little droid and our new local celebrity!
Well, if you hadn't, you wouldn't be here, would ya?
Well, if you wanna keep breathing, you best follow me. This here's Raider territory.
Well, if you're crazy enough to try your best bet is to avoid its mud throws.
Well, in my day, I did watch him spar countless times!
Well, it better work if this Jedi shows up.
Well, it certainly seems you finished it.
Well, it isn't every day you get to meet someone from another century.
Well, it seems you missed the Republic ruins next door.
Well, it spooked my customers something awful. They were pointing and gawking and talking of impending doom.
Well, it sure sounded li - ! Oh. A 'dig'. Because archaeology. Heh.
Well, it's embarrassing.
Well, it's the way of the galaxy. The only constant is change. And everything gets worse with time!
Well, it, eh...ye see, north, it's a relative, eh...
Well, kid, I wasn't thrilled, was I? Those machines were blasted nightmares to operate.
Well, killer, here's another tip: real pros always charge a fee.
Well, lad, I'll tell ye:
Well, lad, we've done it. A tank throngin' with the finest fish!
Well, let's hope we do.
Well, let's look for one together.
Well, let's see how bold she is now that the Trident's online.
Well, look who comes exploring once more.
Well, lotta places in the galaxy. I'm just glad you ended up on our rock.
Well, my agents were ambitious. Scored me a deal that could've had me on billboards all over the Core.
Well, my friend, then you're laboring under a narrow definition of 'tactful'.
Well, no, I mean you look fine.
Well, no, but, ya know, I could. If someone tried anything, you know, I'm ready.
Well, not fun.
Well, not new. But I bet I could find ya one that works.
Well, nothing I can do. 
Well, now, I didn't say that.
Well, of course they couldn't. To have a plan in their head means to have something in their head.
Well, of course. The whole area was devastated when the moon fell on it!
Well, our archives are far from complete, but I'm sure Master Cordova's up to the task.
Well, path seems clear from here, shouldn't get into any trouble. Unless you go lookin' for it.
Well, push comes to shove, and we were boarded.
Well, she did let me hang onto her tuner key.
Well, she must've had her reasons.
Well, so does slicing up Raiders, but you gotta do what you gotta do, right?
Well, someone killed him.
Well, suit yourself.
Well, sure, things are different. Back home, practically every lab is under military funding.
Well, tell you what: we're more than happy to bring holotactics to Pyloon's.
Well, tell your friend to act like the old owner, Abel Drongite.
Well, that be ma tale, Cal. Perhaps it was no as gloomy as I kent.
Well, that didn't work.
Well, that is, until -
Well, that was nice of him.
Well, that was something.
Well, that'll have to do.
Well, that's comforting, I think.
Well, that's not something ye see every day, now is it?
Well, that's the B1s gone.
Well, that's what makes us all so very different, isn't it?
Well, the Mantis looks like it's seen better days.
Well, the feral Snakefish prefers the taste o' crab, but would happily settle fer yer toe.
Well, the protection is helpful. Keeps us alive. I'm fine with that. 
Well, then let's pick up the pace, and make sure that doesn't happen.
Well, then. I've no choice but tae regale you with ma bleakmost history.
Well, there he goes.
Well, there is a Star Destroyer in the sky.
Well, there it is.
Well, there's a stage collecting dust. Perhaps one day we'll hire some off-world bands.
Well, these ain't it. I'm just tending to Brutus here. He's a nekko.
Well, these specimens are lucky to have you here.
Well, they aren't gone yet.
Well, they deserved it.
Well, they don't shoot at us.
Well, they're constantly hungry, constantly craving more sunlight, more space.
Well, they're listenin' to you now, so you might as well take 'em.
Well, this has been an underwhelmin' demonstration.
Well, this is your problem now. And someone's gonna have to deal with this.
Well, uh, we ran into some trouble on our last job.
Well, watch your step. Rockfall is a big problem.
Well, we Sakavians refused! We had the Great Famine to contend with, see. Every fish was precious!
Well, we all have a meetin' that night to decide what to do.
Well, we don't want that.
Well, we got each other.
Well, we survived our first storm together.
Well, we tried plenty of other worlds, but never stayed long.
Well, we're Just fine, now.
Well, we're trying.
Well, we've got a good idea where he's headed. Meet you at the top.
Well, we've got something that'll bring him favor with the Emperor.
Well, well, well.
Well, what do you have to say for yourself?
Well, what do you think is taking Zee so long?
Well, when you're beat, you're beat.
Well, where to start...
Well, y'know, time flies when your disposition is as sunny as an Umbaran graveyard.
Well, ye see...it's equipped with a kind of, eh...
Well, yeah, I stayed on the Mantis, holding down the fort.
Well, yes I am.
Well, yes. It sticks with me, this one, I suppose.
Well, you ain't seeing them no more!
Well, you know Greez. The boss is a culinary innovator who just can't be stopped.
Well, you know how that war turned out...
Well, you know when you first walked in here, I was getting ready to throw you out.
Well, you seem to be making the most of this management opportunity.
Well, you sure got those Raiders tied in knots, but they mostly stayed clear of the Reach.
Well, you will still have to be patient. He's not here yet.
Well, you're here now! Did you hear about Turgle's shell?
Well, you're in luck. I just so happen to have years of management experience under my belt.
Well, you're missing out buddy! Oh, boy...the stunts we got up to - legendary.
Well, you're never one to miss the obvious, are you?
Well, you're safe here.
Well, you've got a mean look to you!
Well, you've got no open tabs, so I suppose all that's left to say is good luck, and -
Well-armored hardshell.
Well.
Well.
Well.
Well. Guess that's that. 
Well. That's that.
Well. When you put it that way.
Well...
Well...
Well...I am no' a creature of comfort, but I've got tae tell ye: I've taken a wee shine tae yer yacht.
Well...sitting here beats dropping anchor on some other, dustier rock, doesn't it?
Well...yeah.
Well?
Well? Say something!
Went into hiding,
Weow be-beep!
Weow bee-bee-beep!
Weow bee-beep!
Weow beep beep!
Weow beep beep!
Weow beep boop!
Weow bo-beep!
Weow boo boop!
Weow de-de-dee!
Weow te-te-dee!
Weow trill!
Weow trill!
Weow trill!
Weow twooooo!
Weow waaa!
Weow waaa!
Were there more like you, the galaxy would be in a far, far better state.
Were they ever simple?
Were those droids arguing?
Were you a big-shot business guy? Oh, oh - did you blow it!?
Were you actually marooned in deep space by Captain Whett?
Were you aiming for me?
Were you even trying?
Were you fired?
Were you worried for her?
Were you worried?
Weren't we all once? The question is how will he overcome it.
Weren't you trained?
Wh -
Wh-whats going on?
Wh... What!?
Wha'?!
Wha-...?
Wha-?!
Wha-what's happening!?
Whaaaaaaaaa....
Whaaaaaat!
Whacked his arm off!
Whadaya think?
Wham! Overboard she went!
What - make sure I look good, right? [chuckle]
What Bode did -
What Dagan has claimed by combat, in the same way Dagan has claimed us.
What Grock here means is, we can make 'em sing again. Yeah, trust us.
What I can see is your obsession with Tanalorr has blinded you.
What I don't understand is how a Jedi snuck down here in the first place.
What I lack in experience I make up for with dedication!
What I mean is that the galaxy is begging to fill your pockets, if only you'll play its game.
What I miss...?
What I must!
What I want to know is why? Must have been something good in there.
What I would give for some of Cere's guidance.
What I would give to see a glimpse of that galaxy...
What I wouldn't give for a fresh Seallia sandwich right now.
What Jedi thinks they can stop us? Fool.
What Jedi trickery is this?
What a brutal display!
What a chump.
What a crutch.
What a cut!
What a day, hm?
What a day.
What a day. You saved the outpost, I found a shell. Things are looking up!
What a delight to see one of your kind in action after all these years.
What a delightful surprise!
What a display!
What a dull galaxy that will be with none to fight.
What a fighter! Ha ha ha.
What a galaxy.
What a gentlemen. Very well.
What a great move from Turgle!
What a haunted old ruin...
What a joke.
What a joy to see you!
What a joy, to know that when my footsteps disappear into the sands, others will take my place.
What a kill!
What a mess of a father I've been.
What a mess. Leaking pipes, exposed wires. A recipe for disaster.
What a move!
What a move!
What a name.
What a performance!
What a rotten raw deal!
What a shot!
What a shot, Bravo!
What a show.
What a show.
What a sight, eh? Can't hardly believe the little bloke pulled it out of the Wash.
What a strike!
What a suck up...
What a thrill!
What a time to be alive!
What a view! I bet I could plant a great garden up here with a little help.
What a view, huh?
What a view.
What a view. 
What a view...
What a waste of tech!
What a waste.
What a waste.
What a weak B2!
What a wingspan. I see why they call ya gliders. Bet you could fly 'round all of Koboh, couldn't ya?
What about Captain Whett? Did he survive?
What about a collapsed mine escape room?
What about a fabrication facility on the moon?
What about something like this?
What about survivors?
What about that barge?
What about that beam?
What about the prisoner?
What about us, Cal?
What about us, Merrin?
What about when they find out you're selling relics from an active Imperial search zone?
What about you new guy? You in this for the credits?
What about you, Greez?
What about you, old boy?
What about you?
What about you?
What about you? You seem to spend a lot of time here.
What ails you, sojourner?
What am I doing?
What am I, a fortune teller? We'll find out on Koboh.
What am I, a tour guide? I'm a busy Latero. No time to visit broken moons.
What am I, blind?
What an attack!
What an engrossing sequence of play.
What are families for?
What are my coordinates? I can't even see my hand!
What are my orders?
What are our orders today?
What are our orders when locating Jedi?
What are our orders?
What are the Raiders doing here?
What are the Raiders doing here?
What are the odds Moran will ever get outta bankruptcy?
What are the orders on encountering enemies?

What are we going to do with him, Cal?
What are we looking for out here?
What are we looking for?
What are we waiting for?
What are ya, a med droid? Listen, I got it all worked out: I run the scans, you snatch the score.

What if I was?
What if something were to go wrong?
What if they found the device Rayvis is looking for?
What if those drinks were poisoned?

What these troopers lack is the true will to serve the Empire!
What they always do, terrorize and rob folks just trying to survive on this rock.
What they always do, terrorize folks like us, just trying to survive on this rock.
What they may lack in skill, they cannot lack in dedication!

What's my tell?
What's new for you?
What's next fer ye? Where does the wind take ye?

What, and leave you here?
What, are you crazy!?
What, she can do that?
What, why are you mad with me?

What? Join them?
What? Me? That's preposterous.
What? N-no, never. Just idle talk.
What? No stims for me?
What? No, this is a patrol.
What? No.
What? No. Clean your own blaster.
What? No. Never. You must be hearing things. Or tired.
What? No. No way. I mean if she approached me, I guess I...why am I sweating?
What? Pff, 'course we will! We got a real bona fide Jedi to look after us.
What? Sorry I wasn't listening.
What? Too much for you?
What? Uh oh, oh! Oh no!

What??
Whatcha got, Caij?
Whatcha got?
Whatever Dagan commands, Rayvis will see it done.
Whatever I did, it doesn't seem to have helped. The echo is still here.
Whatever I did, it seems to have helped.
Whatever completes our orders to the letter.
Whatever did I do to be worthy of such an honor?
Whatever gets the job done. I have no other interest otherwise.
Whatever happened here caused the Republic to evacuate Koboh.
Whatever happened tore this moon apart.
Whatever happened,
Whatever he used to cross the Abyss, maybe we'll find it there.
Whatever intel the Senator's got stashed...I hope it's worth the risk.
Whatever is out there is mine.
Whatever is required.
Whatever it is,
Whatever it is, beast's taken a shine to you. May as well make the most of that.
Whatever it was, I think it's better now. C'mon, BD.
Whatever it was, I'll find it.
Whatever keeps you occupied.
Whatever neutralizes the threat, trooper.
Whatever quirks are going on in your wires, droid, they make for some interesting delusions of grandeur.
Whatever that thing is, I do not like it!
Whatever they stole, you are not permitted to know, understood?
Whatever this "Emergence" did, it's clear to me that it didn't stamp out Koboh's spirit.
Whatever this Jedi wants, I'm sure they won't succeed!
Whatever this device is, Dagan killed other Jedi for it.
Whatever you did up there sure kicked the firebug nest!
Whatever you find, I want a cut!
Whatever you say!
Whatever you say, Cal.
Whatever you say, Moran.
Whatever you say.
Whatever you're being paid, I'll double it.
Whatever you're doing, be quick. We need to get to the safe house.

Whatever's needed.
Whatever, you're lucky I'm thirsty.
Whatever.
Whatever.
Whatever. I gotta figure out what he changed. If he changed anything.
Whatever. Those were made of plastoid.
Whatever. You're lucky I'm thirsty.
Whats this?
When Dagan Gera reclaims Tanalorr, and rises to supreme power, we will all rise with him.
When Doma unpacked me, she thought I was trash!
When I arrived on Koboh, I noticed a charlatan trying to swindle someone with Fool's Priorite.
When I awoke from my last duel with Wan'yek, it was on the deck of a fishin' schooner.
When I awoke...well, find me again and I'll conclude ma tale!
When I came across these struggling seeds, I had to tend to them.
When I find you...
When I first came here, I did not expect it to be like this.
When I first got here, I did a little exploring of my own.
When I get bored, I have a tendency to start taking things apart.
When I get down...
When I get down...
When I get free, you're-!
When I grow up, I wanna be a botanist, Pili.
When I heard the Mantis was arriving, I offered to guide you.
When I heard what had happened to the Order, it was too late.
When I needed to.
When I saw the dock collapse, I thought this heist might be over real quick.
When I strike it rich.
When I visited, I felt the weight of the past upon me. I am sure you will too.
When I was a Padawan, they taught us your time was a Golden Age of peace and prosperity.
When I was on Kashyyyk, I saw the Empire tearing down forests and enslaving Wookiees.
When I was your age, I would dance with my sisters, long into the night.
When Koboh's moon was shattered, the Republic settlement collapsed, leaving those spires.
When a target is acquired.
When am I going to see that famous blaster of yours in action?
When are these people going to learn?
When did you get so hurt?

When the fighting starts, stay out of my way, droid.
When the fighting starts, you're first up, got it? Right in front.

When the target appears, I get the first shot.
When the target arrives, I will be ready. I will crush them.
When they said 'Core', I heard, like, 'Chandrila'. Nah, they meant Coruscant.
When things cool off,
When things settle down, maybe we can explore Jedha together.
When this place gets a little too much, I feel the call to explore. There's always something out there to check out.
When was the last time you talked to Kata?
When we are victorious, what will our purpose be?
When we blast out of here, you'll get the best seats in the house!
When we confront Bode, just remember. He has what he wants. He will fight to the death to keep it.

When we left the city, seeking to avoid Imperial eyes, Master Junda led us here.
When we started out here, life was grand.

When you left...
When you patrol long enough, nothing surprises you.
When you were living on Birren, what'd you do for a living?
When you're ready, I'll meet you in the clouds.
When you're ready, make a move on that gantry. I'll be watching.
When you're ready.

Where are they going?
Where are they interrogating the Jedi?
Where are we now? And how do we get out?

Where is the target? Where is the Jedi?
Where is this Jedi?
Where is this Jedi? This location is lifeless.
Where is your power, Jedi?
Where should we go next?
Where should we go, buddy?
Where should we go?
Where should we take her first?
Where the - !
Where the hell am I gonna find a buyer for this fuel injector? Grock would know!
Where this one goes, death follows.
Where to go, Kestis!?
Where to go, where to go?
Where to next BD?
Where to next?
Where to next?
Where to, kid?
Where was I? Aye - she flopped overboard like a quellfish wriggling out of a tin! The crab yanked 'er in by the nostril!

Where were we? Ah, yes. By virtue of my prodigious fishing talents,
Where were you stationed before this?

Where's your edge?
Where's your strength!?
Where's your technique?
Where's...the target?
Where...?
Where...who?
Where?
Where? Where? I'll look!
Wherever I lay down my head at night.
Wherever he is, we need him. This is not good.
Wherever your journey takes you, Cal Kestis. I wish you good luck!
Whether there is or there isn't, we are not tasked to question the orders of the Empire. Understood, stormtrooper?
Whew, that was a tough one.
Which begs the question...why team up with one?!
Which do we want...
Which form?
Which is sharper? Stone or water?
Which is the exact opposite of what I tell 'em!
Which is why this must make it back to Master Junda.
Which is why, on this blasted world, I just don't bother.
Which one? There are currently 52,970 X-34 landspeeders in circulation.
Which planet next...
Which they don't! Haha!
Which they don't! Haha!
Which training?
Which variant should we go for?
Which way to the officer's quarters?
Which way?
Which we must preserve and cultivate together, yes?
Which would look good here?
Which you broke.
Which, by the way, nice touch. Love a big entrance!
While back, in one of my last postings, rumor went round that we caught and killed a Jedi.
While she's at it, maybe she could hunt for a personality.
While the Empire's trained its eyes on you,
While waves of fear swirl around the cantina, they crash against our boulder and abate.
Who am I kidding? I chose the wrong profession. Shoulda wised up and chose the flame trooper track.
Who approaches?
Who are - !
Who are you?
Who are you?!
Who asked you?
Who brings a sword to a blaster fight?!
Who can tell what kind of lethal creatures might be waiting for us.
Who cares, then?
Who cares.
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares? Run for your life, unless you wanna die on this rock!
Who cares? They're all gone.
Who cares? They're not hurting you.
Who did that? Who's there?
Who did...what?
Who do you serve?
Who do you think got picked to pilot the new drill?
Who does this Jedi think they are, trespassing on Imperial territory?
Who does?
Who else wants a turn?
Who even needs a jetpack, huh?
Who ever made the score of a lifetime by being 'more careful'?
Who goes there?
Who goes there?
Who has time for that?
Who is next?
Who is that?
Who is that?
Who is that?
Who is this!?
Who is this? Someone from your past?
Who knows what they were doing here before we showed up.
Who knows, maybe you're "one with the Force" now.
Who knows, we might make it, but I don't think your droids will.
Who needs a good scratch?
Who needs a jetpack?
Who needs a shield?
Who programmed clankers to talk so much?
Who programmed you to think that? It's, uh, a little naive, to put it lightly.
Who programmed you? It's clearly some kind of mining laser.
Who promised that? We must be careful, Cal. Keep counsel only with those we trust.
Who says that?
Who says we're looking for anything? We're sending a message.
Who taught you that?
Who taught you that?
Who taught you that?
Who taught you to hunt, Mosey?
Who taught you to move like that?
Who the bloody hell are you?
Who threw that grenade!?
Who told you?
Who trained you?
Who wants some of that?
Who wants some?
Who was that girl I killed? Were you close?
Who was that?
Who would win in a fight between a Droideka and a MagnaGuard?
Who you talking to, Greez?
Who's back there?
Who's back there?
Who's back there?
Who's going to try to get in here? This place is a graveyard.

Whoa, now.
Whoa, they don't look friendly.
Whoa, watch out!

Whoever built this must've known the pattern of the storms. Impressive.
Whoever lived here is long gone. Wonder what they were making?
Whoever owns it must not be far off.
Whoever's there, get lost!
Whole new perspective, isn't it?
Whole ship knows we're here now, huh?
Whole unit eradicated.
Whole villages can live in one of these crawlers, traveling across planets as a single unit.
Whoo!
Whoo! Good fight!
Whoo! Got him!
Whooaaa!
Whooooah!
Whooop.
Whoop.
Whoop.

Why are we playin' this game?
Why are you all so bad at this?
Why are you always yammering about Rayvis and glory?
Why are you bigger and stronger than me?

Why bother?
Why bother? Ya dead already.
Why can't I move?
Why can't I move?
Why can't I move?!
Why can't any of you go look?
Why couldn't the refugees have stayed in the Archive?
Why couldn't we sense him?
Why did I ever retire!?
Why did he go?
Why did the Inquisitorius send you here?
Why did they assign me with a BX droid? I can take down this Jedi just fine by myself!
Why did they make that big ring around the ship?
Why did they post me here? We don't even know what this thing does!
Why did you activate the -
Why did you activate the Array?
Why did you approach me?
Why did you join the Raiders?
Why did you really want to come out here?
Why did your patrol take so long?
Why didn't our scanners pick up this storm?
Why didn't the Empire give us a nickname?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me? I could've cleaned up the place! Oh this is just perfect.
Why do Anchorites wear masks?
Why do I always get assigned to these backwater posts?

Why do I have to do this?
Why do I have to go?
Why do I have to stay with you?

Why do they need us here if they've got that big drill?
Why do we have to fight the Jedi?
Why do you always look distracted?
Why do you ask?
Why do you delay!?
Why do you keep letting him escape?
Why do you keep this up?
Why do you pause, outlander?
Why do you say that?
Why do you think a Jedi tried to infiltrate this base?
Why do you think?
Why do you try?
Why do you work on droids? They're non-believers.
Why does a Jedi carry a lightsaber?
Why don't we have stims?
Why don't you ask her?
Why don't you come back when you have enough.
Why don't you drop the shield and we'll find out?
Why don't you get offworld, try your hand somewhere less dangerous?
Why don't you head down to the basement, check out your new digs? We can have a chat after you rest.
Why don't you join us on Tanalorr?
Why don't you remove my binders, we'll make it a fair fight.
Why don't you return once you locate more scrolls?
Why don't you send a drink Bode's way? Wouldn't have been able save her without his help.
Why don't you want to take this fight?
Why else would I get sent to this total void of a planet?
Why else would you deceive the council?
Why else would you end up here?
Why else? So we can cut them apart.
Why even send stormtroopers? We always get the job done.
Why even try?
Why fight when you can't win?
Why hello there!
Why is that?
Why is the Brood looking for you on Coruscant? Isn't that a real bad neighborhood for you these days?
Why is this door shut?
Why is this happening!?
Why is this happening?!
Why is this my responsibility? 
Why is...what is...?
Why make it easy for 'em?
Why me!?
Why me!?
Why me?!
Why must they die so quickly?
Why not ask her yourself?
Why not burn them, then?
Why not now? Are you - this is a complicated bit of machinery, and I really think it's best -
Why not power down for a few cycles, then?
Why not us?
Why not?
Why not? I'm a gregarious guy. Love a good party. I'm good with money.
Why not? Let's take her for a ride sometime.
Why not? The bounty could be your ticket offworld.
Why not? You've failed.
Why resist?
Why resist?
Why should I? What's it done for me? Nothing.
Why should we?
Why should we?
Why so positive, Moran? I thought you were desperate to get off this rock.
Why the Stinger Mantis?
Why try?
Why visit one dig site when you could read about thirty, right?
Why wait? Why not now?
Why was I given this command!?
Why were you so excited to enlist?
Why won't this piece of junk work!?
Why won't you die!?
Why won't you just die?!
Why would I do that, 'sir'.
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?
Why would anyone kill a bogling?
Why would anyone pour time and resources into that lousy rock, anyway?
Why would you do such a thing?
Why would you want that?
Why wouldn't it be?
Why ya runnin'!
Why ya runnin'!
Why you-!
Why'd we have to come back here...
Why'd ya ask me here? I don't like you, and you don't like me.
Why'd ya join back up, anyways?
Why'd you all die?
Why'd you damage my jetpack?
Why'd you do that?!
Why'd you get assigned to this squad?
Why'd you have to come along?
Why'd you stop?
Why're you running?
Why's that?
Why's that?
Why's that?
Why've you been breathing down my neck so much lately?
Why, Bode?
Why, Bode?!
Why, hello.
Why, if I weren't holding you up, I'd probably be buyin'!
Why, indeed. You know, a few short years ago, I thought Koboh wasn't such a bad place to lie low.
Why, you miss me?
Why, you're looking hale and hearty, Moran. Warms my circuits.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why? Are you worried I'll kill too many, make you look bad?
Why? Aren't you good?
Why? Do you want a crack at him?
Why? It's a peaceful life, plenty of space for Kata to play.
Why? You're doing enough for the both of us.
Wild species detected.

Will I see you at the saloon tonight?
Will do! Now, you're not talking about Greez, are you?
Will do, Monk.
Will do.
Will do.
Will do.
Will do.
Will do.
Will do.
Will it be a complete memory purge?
Will not falter.
Will somebody put down this Jedi?!
Will that art help us fight a Jedi.
Will there be more people?
Will we get special dispensation if we're injured fighting the Jedi?
Will you be able to protect my little girl?
Will you come visit from time to time?
Will you come with us, Greez?
Will you endure?
Will you get a load of this!
Will you join us?
Will you leave?
Will you relent?
Will you show us the way?
Will you take some advice, Cal?
Will you teach me?
Will you work for Saw Gerrera again?
Wind's too strong.
Winged him!
Winged.
Wini is living proof that credits can't buy everything.
Wini says I've got to go. What's it like?
Wiping out the pest.
Wisdom is a good that never decays, and is always in short supply.
Wise counsel. I am in your debt.
Wise words. I will keep this in mind as our own garden grows.
Wise-guys.
Wish I could stop.
Wish I could've talked that tibidee down. But there are some fights you just can't avoid.
Wish I had a treat for you.
Wish I had more of 'em.
Wish the rest of these scrappers did the same.
Wish we could help.
Wish you died with the rest of your kind, traitor!
With Abel you could go hundreds of cycles without paying your tab.
With Kata on-board, coming here to where, well, you know...
With Purge Troopers on the base? I doubt it.
With Rayvis at the helm, our victory is assured.
With Rayvis dead, the Bedlam Raiders have been wounded. This makes them dangerous.
With Rayvis gone, maybe other lowlifes will get the message.
With a Jedi on the prowl, seems the perfect time to test these BX droids out.
With a mogu, it never is. They're relentless even on the brink of death.
With all your expeditions, what keeps you on Koboh?
With an investment of 3000 credits, you could--
With each kill, the Empire grows stronger.
With ease. You'll be scrap in seconds.
With eight children, thirty-six grandchildren, and two loth-cats, she was cooking for a small army.
With great honor comes great risk.
With me! After the intruder!
With me.
With my lovely assistant.
With my luck.
With pleasure.
With pleasure.
With right calibration, a blaster could pass right through Mandalorian armor.
With the Empire everywhere, do you think Rambler's Reach has a chance?
With the Empire here, thought I'd have a chance to turn a credit, try selling useless scrap to a stormtrooper.
With the Raiders on the run, I'm 'bout as good as I've ever been.
With the size of the Imperial Navy, I'm surprised there aren't more Purge Troopers.
With these blasters right here. Any insubordination, a shot to the chest will sort them out.
With this one?
With what? And why are you whispering?
With who?
With your first, young Master.
With your, uh, modest frame, I'm sure you could get right into all those nooks and crannies. What do you say?
Within acceptable parameters.
Within capabilities.
Within my power.
Within our holotactics game table, of course.
Within the Abyss the Empire cannot reach us.
Without Cordova, that will take some time.
Without a code, you can only serve yourself.
Without delay.
Without discipline, what do we have?
Without it I'll be starting all over from scratch. I mean, even more than I already am.
Without your guidance, I'd never have made it here in one piece.
Witness real power, Jedi.
Witness true power.
Wo-wah be bo ba bee!
Wo-wah be-be-bee!
Wo-wah be-dee boo!
Wo-wah bee doo!
Wo-wah bo-bo-boo!
Wo-wah bo-bo-boo!
Wo-wah trill bee!
Woe betide any lubber who dares to steal a fish from Skoova Stev!
Woe to the wicked!
Woe unto the vanquished.
Womp rat.
Won't be able to look at Pyloon's the same way again. She fronted me the money, never got to visit.
Won't be easy to get her back.
Won't be easy when the desert's littered with Imps.
Won't be locked for long. 
Won't be much of fight...
Won't be shooting flames anymore.
Won't block this. 
Won't budge. Let's come back later.
Won't catch me, Jedi. 
Won't catch them all. 
Won't dodge this. 
Won't evade this!
Won't evade this!
Won't find that anywhere else.
Won't get me.
Won't get me. 
Won't get me. 
Won't get through!
Won't happen. 
Won't kill me. 
Won't know what hit 'em!
Won't let him take me!
Won't matter.
Won't miss 'em!
Won't miss again.
Won't miss that bug.
Won't open from this side.
Won't save you. 
Won't shake me!
Won't shake me!
Won't stop me. 
Won't we Cal?
Wonder how Merrin's faring.
Wonder if Cere and Cordova know about this place.
Wonder if Greez and Bode fixed the Mantis by now.
Wonder if anyone survived.
Wonder if it has anything to do with that Forest Array.
Wonder if that botanist is interested in expanding her brand.
Wonder if there is a way to stop that door from closing when I grab the orb.
Wonder if these prospectors ever found what they were looking for.
Wonder if they're always this riled up, or if this one just had a mean temper.
Wonder if what happened on Coruscant...
Wonder what I would've been if I'd lived during the High Republic.
Wonder what happens when we activate them all.
Wonder what my life would have been like back then.
Wonder what secrets this place is hiding.
Wonder what that does.
Wonder what that was...
Wonder what the pay bonus is for killing a Jedi.
Wonder what this is, buddy.
Wonder what this was for.
Wonder what those other markers mean.
Wonder what's waiting for us in the temple.
Wonder where we should go next...
Wonder where we should put this...
Wonder where we'll find them next.
Wonder who was trying to keep things hidden.
Wonder why the Raiders brought it back to life.
Wonderful to see you, Cal. How are you?
Wonderful! Then my sensors aren't in need of maintenance. Carry on!
Wonderful, a battle of minds.
Wonderful, new seeds. Plant one. I'll share its details.
Wonderful, you've found all the seed variants!
Wonderful.
Wonderful. It has been some time since I have been there, but I found its resonance with the Force quite moving.
Wonderful. Simply wonderful.
Wondrous! I knew you could do it.
Woo!
Woo!
Woo! We've got a fighter here!
Woo, no coming back from that.
Woo-woo!
Woo...
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Wooo!
Wooo!
Wooo-eee!
Woooo!
Woooo.
Woooo...
Woooo...
Wooooo.
Wooop boop.
Woop woop.
Woop-oop!
Woop-oop!
Word has it that 'Greezy Money' Dritus is reunited with the Stinger Mantis at long last.
Word has it that a Brood gunslinger named Meyen Corr has been wandering around the east side of the valley.
Word is he's got something even bigger cooking.
Word is that Rayvis got bumped off.
Word is there was an assassination attempt.
Word is there's a traveling troubadour and a DJ droid from the Core Worlds on Koboh.
Word is you killed some Jedi relic from the past - the one leading the Raiders. What was the bounty?
Word is you went toe to toe with a gorocco!
Word is you're planning to rescue my new favorite droid.
Word is you've got a secret admirer on Jedha - big droid called Yuhong. Lookin' to replace the little guy?
Word of your arrival has spread quickly, noble one. Master Junda holds you in high esteem.
Word traveled that fast, huh?
Word travels fast around here.
Word travels fast.
Work harder. 
Worked hard for 'em.
Working on it!
Working together, the Republic and the Jedi Order can understand the mysteries of the galaxy...
Works with my grapple. Could help us climb the tower.
Worried? 
Worry about yourself, then.
Worse, they repurposed my lab into a biochemical weapons facility. All my research, now used as a means for death.
Worth a one-in-a-million shot through a stellar anomaly?
Worth a shot.
Worth a shot.
Worth checking out, right?
Worth every credit.
Worthless
Worthless resistance. 
Would love to chat, but I'm waiting for Greez. He's been in that back room muttering to himself.
Would need some better ventilation, though...
Would take an awful lot of firepower to blow a chunk out this moon.
Would they ever entrust a stormtrooper to hunt down a Jedi?
Would you just do it!?
Would you like to hear about it?
Would you like to stop and rest?
Would you look at that!
Would you look at that...
Would you look at that... perfect view of the Koboh Abyss.
Would you mind cleaning my blaster?
Would've liked to see you scrapping ships on Bracca in your younger days.
Wouldn't be an Inquisitor here if it was a hoax, rookie.
Wouldn't be here if there was.
Wouldn't be much of a life at all, huh?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Wouldn't even call it mine at this point. Beast does what it wants.
Wouldn't go wrong with this material.
Wouldn't have made it out alive without his help.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Wouldn't know. Never been there myself. Too steep to climb.
Wouldn't mind retirin' in the Onderonian merchant quarter.
Wouldn't mind walking Pilgrim's Path again with this boost.
Wouldn't that be just dreadful!?
Wouldn't think of it. Is this the 'one way trip to an early grave' you were hinting at earlier?
Wouldn't want to get hit with that!
Wouldn't want to keep the senator waiting.
Wouldn't you like that?
Wouldn't you like to know? Call it a contingency plan. 
Wouldn't you rather your death meant something?
Wounded target found. 
Wounded. Alone.
Wow!
Wow!
Wow! How can you see those?
Wow, I can't even hit him.
Wow, I could never pull that off!
Wow, I'm good.
Wow, Tulakt! Wow!
Wow, didn't see that coming.
Wow, he took out a droideka?
Wow, look at you, changing your clothes all the time. Me? I prefer consistency.
Wow, looks like someone's excited. And I'm not talking about BD. Heh.
Wow, mine's 42X-58939.
Wow, our family's growing with a boatload of creepy aunts and uncles.
Wow, so believable. The intel, how was it?
Wow, that is old.
Wow, that looked bad.
Wow, that's better.
Wow, that's pretty profound.
Wow, this escalated quickly.
Wow, those shields did nothing.
Wow, what a view.
Wow, what was that!? Must be old programming!
Wow, you're slow!
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow. Amazing.
Wow. How about that...
Wow. Jealous, I am jealous.
Wow. That's very impressive. I'm honored to fight alongside you.
Wrath!
Wrath!
Wub-wub-wub.
Y'all are feelin' this right?
Y'hear that!?
Y'hear that?
Y'know what, Turgle? You could use that speed to stay out of trouble.
Y'know, I like the sound of those odds.
Y'know, I'm glad, too. I didn't get outta there, I never woulda met the old man.
Y'know, Monk does do a pretty good job at keeping this place together.
Y'know, Pyloon's Saloon down in the outpost is starving for some live entertainment.
Y'know, lad, sometimes the truth brings peace - an' sometimes it brings sadness.
Y'know, my daughter loves gadgets.
Y'know, prophecies describing where a coupla enterprising folk might find a real haul.
Y'know, teach, if you're in the market for a job, I could use a brainbox like you in my outfit.
Y'know, you weren't the first to take a swing at that Gen'Dai. Ever hear about Taule?
Y-yes.
Y-yessir, of course! Just hope this thing doesn't break...
Y-you! I was-
Y-you'll regret this!
Y-you're mine!
Y-you're...leaving? You'll be back right? Right!?
Ya afraid?
Ya afraid?
Ya can't stop em all!
Ya can't stop em all!
Ya caught me!
Ya caught me!
Ya caught me!
Ya caught me!
Ya done now.
Ya feelin' okay? 
Ya feelin' okay? 
Ya gonna get killed with that attitude, Cal. But on a certain level, I can respect it.
Ya know the best way to listen to Ashe's music?
Ya know, I once asked a protocol droid to calculate that.
Ya know, I once heard Turgle sing.
Ya know, Pili and her plants have a lot in common.
Ya like that?
Ya like that?
Ya look terrible.
Ya lost 'em!
Ya lost 'em!
Ya make do with what you have.
Ya mighta seen me in here with my treasure-huntin' partner, Grock. Big geezer - had a frown that could drill rock.
Ya slippery...
Ya slippery...
Yaaah!
Yaaah!
Yaargh!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah! Come on!
Yah, yah!
Yah, yah!
Yawn!
Yawn.
Ye dinnae believe me.
Ye heard the hook-and-line calling yer name too, eh, laddie?
Ye may ask, 'Skoova, ye old salt, have ye lost yer rudder? Are ye plannin' tae cook yerself into buttered chum?'
Ye see that, lad? The blue-finned crayfish is a fearsome warrior.
Ye see, the Frilled Newt is the most sensual of seafolk. Skittish - except when it spies a potential mate.
Ye see, the fishies - they had the right of it.
Ye still think I'm small-time, eh?
Ye're back!
Ye've the aspect of a fisher, lad - and, lucky fer you, we're perched just above the lair of the See fish.
Yea... That's too bad.
Yeah - wasn't sleeping.
Yeah Greez.
Yeah I guess it is.
Yeah I'll take that.
Yeah Monk, I guess they do.
Yeah back off!
Yeah but first I gotta fix the Mantis before the Raiders snatch it.
Yeah but that's why I'm here.
Yeah hey we had some good times didn't we, huh? Me, you, the space witch. Cere. Have you talked to her lately?
Yeah it could be a home.
Yeah it was.
Yeah it's an old prospectors' legend about a lost world filled with treasure!
Yeah it's good to see you too, Greez.
Yeah okay, I understand that.
Yeah see, that's nice. Merrin, you could learn something from her, ya know?
Yeah that would do it.
Yeah yeah yeah. Maybe next time you'll check for syndicate tats before you pick a fight.
Yeah yeah, you too, BD.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah. Oh, and how could I forget Pyloon's saloon? I'm the owner and proprietor.
Yeah yeah...maybe.
Yeah you too.
Yeah your description, uh, didn't do it justice.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! 
Yeah! Creature down!
Yeah! Gave the place character!
Yeah! Get him!
Yeah! Got him!
Yeah! I got him!
Yeah! Someone else take a hit!
Yeah! Take that!
Yeah! That thing's dead!
Yeah! Wait, yeah? I don't actually get it.
Yeah! You better run!
Yeah, BD and I may have pushed a button or two at the Forest Array...
Yeah, Cal and Bode, they ain't exactly the cleaning types.
Yeah, Gabs, Bravo, the twins, we were close.
Yeah, Greez won't be happy about this at all.
Yeah, I don't love the idea either.
Yeah, I felt his presence there too.
Yeah, I figured.
Yeah, I get it.
Yeah, I get it.
Yeah, I get that, I do.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I gotcha. So you took off?
Yeah, I guess I can see it.
Yeah, I guess so. There's some new faces around here, but somehow I still feel alone in the crowd.
Yeah, I hope so.
Yeah, I just might.
Yeah, I know the feeling, Wini.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah, I know, we still got a lot of work ahead of us.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I miss them too.
Yeah, I nabbed it from some prospector after fillin' them full of blaster holes.
Yeah, I suppose you would, wouldn't you?
Yeah, I think it was probably just idle chatter in the barracks.
Yeah, I think so, too.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Yeah, I thought I saw something.
Yeah, I understand.
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Yeah, I'll stay ignorant. Please.
Yeah, I'm thinking about turning it down. I feel like I can do more damage on the front lines. 
Yeah, I've heard Jedi avoid attachment, but...
Yeah, I've seen it.
Yeah, I've seen your type of person before. I'm glad, it's better you're on my side than theirs.
Yeah, Toa was tellin' me all about it. Course, she wanted to put 'em behind glass.
Yeah, a little.
Yeah, actually. Thought you might be telling tales.
Yeah, after Dana dropped a half-ton durasteel brace on me.
Yeah, and hopefully they won't blow us apart.
Yeah, and how you can't go anywhere without getting into their business. Hi BD.
Yeah, and it hasn't made a difference.
Yeah, and there's always one Turgle everywhere you go!
Yeah, because I - [sigh]
Yeah, because they tasted his food!
Yeah, bit lonely in here, huh.
Yeah, bring it on!
Yeah, but Bode has a knack for keeping me on the right side of blaster fire.
Yeah, but I made some good friends. They didn't know, but I felt safer when I was around them.
Yeah, but I really don't want to be wounded.
Yeah, but I was really hoping they would do it for us.
Yeah, but I'd be careful exploring it. It did a number on Zee.
Yeah, but I've got a crate of Korsian pegnuts in storage. Just have to find a buyer.
Yeah, but c'mon. Did ya never cook a meal for yourself in the last years?
Yeah, but don't worry, I got your back.
Yeah, but in the end, Salpu died doing what he loved.
Yeah, but no eating in the cockpit. That's the rules.
Yeah, but so is Doma!
Yeah, but that was hours ago.
Yeah, but your flank is bigger.
Yeah, c'mon! You are a classic.
Yeah, clearly.
Yeah, come on!
Yeah, could be word's out on that I'm the best cook this side of the Hydian Way.
Yeah, definitely Merrin's work.
Yeah, especially since we've got another crew member.
Yeah, exaaactly.
Yeah, fair enough. Not so easy to capture one alive, though.
Yeah, fine.
Yeah, for the Bedlam Raiders.
Yeah, glad she wants to help us find Tanalorr.
Yeah, going up there alone is a death sentence. Guaranteed.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Yeah, good thing Dagan sent so many of us.
Yeah, guess it does.
Yeah, ha ha! Oh, you said it!
Yeah, hasn't ditched us yet
Yeah, he does. More importantly, he's standin' in the way of my survival!
Yeah, he was scared of me. 
Yeah, her leaving the planet is soothing me right now!
Yeah, her name is Merrin. She's -
Yeah, hopefully.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah, it definitely saw less action since you left.
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, it really was.
Yeah, it really was.
Yeah, it was a wild time. We made a lot of credits together. And even more enemies.
Yeah, it was delicious!
Yeah, it was fun. 'Til she burned half the food silo down.
Yeah, it's Zee.
Yeah, it's a warning.
Yeah, it's hard to find a true friend. Someone you have a real connection with.
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Yeah, just a smidge rusty. You?
Yeah, just gotta keep pushing, huh?
Yeah, let 'em do something.
Yeah, let's check it out.
Yeah, let's find the crew.
Yeah, let's keep our distance this time.
Yeah, let's not stick around any longer than we have to.
Yeah, let's scope it out. Dagan Gera was bound to leave something behind.
Yeah, like what?
Yeah, like you're not afraid of nothing! Maybe you can find what all this fuss is about.
Yeah, long time ago, sure. I did a tour of the Jedi Temple...
Yeah, maybe I will.
Yeah, maybe I'll give it a look.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, maybe. But, you know, it's not the same.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah, me neither.
Yeah, me neither. Whole district's on edge.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, me too. There'd be less to repair on the Mantis.
Yeah, must've been. I wish it were bigger.
Yeah, nice.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah, no problem.
Yeah, no thanks.
Yeah, not bad.
Yeah, not bad. Wish that ship wasn't there.
Yeah, not on my bucket list.
Yeah, now shut it up!
Yeah, now you're thinking. Let's get outta here.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, one was enough.
Yeah, or we'd tear you to scraps!
Yeah, picked it up when I worked as a scrapper. Mostly old Clone Warships.
Yeah, right into the ground.
Yeah, says who?
Yeah, see you around. 
Yeah, she talks funny, I like that.
Yeah, she thinks Tanalorr could really help the Path.
Yeah, she's been through a lot, but she's a tough one.
Yeah, she's something else.
Yeah, someone ran up a tab in your name!
Yeah, something tells me this isn't just any Imperial base.
Yeah, sometimes I wish I could go back there. See what it was really like to rough it.
Yeah, sure, I'll bet it does, the way you fly!
Yeah, sure, whatever you need, c'mon, grab some seat! Listen, Monk, get my friend something special to drink!
Yeah, sure. He's got his circuits wired right, he can handle the place while I'm gone.
Yeah, sure. I can do this.
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.
Yeah, take that!
Yeah, that checks out.
Yeah, that makes sense!
Yeah, that might be nice.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, that sounds like what I'm missing.
Yeah, that's good. I like that.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Yeah, that's probably what the shuttle pilot said.
Yeah, that's right, she did.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right. It's a Latero dish, you ever been there?
Yeah, that's what the Empire does best.
Yeah, the Abyss sheds this stuff, might even be made of it.
Yeah, the Empire has everyone so afraid they just look out for themselves. What was it like back then?
Yeah, the Jedi's long gone, and command says the senator's yacht is secure.
Yeah, there's no challenge here. No fight.
Yeah, they both belong in the dirt.
Yeah, they called me the Prince of Pilfering, the Mayor of Misdemeanors, the Sultan of Stealth!
Yeah, they do.
Yeah, think so.
Yeah, think so.
Yeah, this is the place. A Jedi and an Inquisitor. 
Yeah, those are enormous.
Yeah, those are pretty fun, too.
Yeah, today's not good.
Yeah, took me quite a while before I realized he was already dead.
Yeah, until things go sideways.
Yeah, we did. 'Cause I'm smart. See, those gangsters might be trouble, but they pay for top talent.
Yeah, we get him angry, he comes for one of us. The other takes him out.
Yeah, we get it.
Yeah, we had some, uh... technical problems.
Yeah, we just have to find a route down.
Yeah, we scared him off.
Yeah, we worry that if they keep being such cowards, they'll be dead by tomorrow.
Yeah, we'll help you find him.
Yeah, we're done here.
Yeah, we're in. We'll catch you back at the outpost.
Yeah, well that ain't always a bad thing, now is it?
Yeah, well that's when they get ya!
Yeah, well we're gonna have a word, then.
Yeah, well, at least before Cal Kestis got his hands on it.
Yeah, well. Sometimes, the payout isn't worth the price.
Yeah, why not? I bet people would appreciate it.
Yeah, why's that?
Yeah, working with a group called the Hidden Path. Real hush-hush stuff, so keep it in the family.
Yeah, working with a group called the Hidden Path. Real hush-hush stuff, so keep it in the family.
Yeah, yeah me too.
Yeah, yeah, I heard ya. I'm grateful for that, at least.
Yeah, yeah, long time ago. For a tournament.
Yeah, yeah, they're...
Yeah, yeah, we'll be fine, and all the things we used to say.
Yeah, yeah, well, last time I left on a lunch break, you moved my favorite cleaning rag.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I saw what Cere ate. I don't trust a Jedi's definition of 'food'.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you'll be fine.
Yeah, yeah. Now where's my spatula?
Yeah, yeah. We've been wasting away on this mountain so long.
Yeah, you better run!
Yeah, you could say that.
Yeah, you could say there was peril.
Yeah, you could've been down here forever.
Yeah, you made a bad call, friend.
Yeah, you too, lil' guy.
Yeah, you too.
Yeah, you're going down!
Yeah, you're probably right.
Yeah, you're quick. 
Yeah, you're right. It'll take more than some TIE fighters flying overhead to break our spirits!
Yeah, you're right. They probably don't want me to make the other droids look bad.
Yeah, you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. A lot's changed since this was built.
Yeah. BD and I we, uh, were inside the firing cylinder.
Yeah. BD, call the ships.
Yeah. But you and I got lost a few times, and we found our way.
Yeah. Focused.
Yeah. From what I hear, his enemies end up in Turbo Dogs.
Yeah. He's as friendly as ever.
Yeah. I hear you.
Yeah. I hope that intel we got off the senator gets put to good use.
Yeah. I keep thinking...about what happened on Nova Garon.
Yeah. I miss her.
Yeah. I should probably find Greez.
Yeah. I'd be even more excited.
Yeah. It lit a fire in me. Pushed myself as hard as I could.
Yeah. It'll be good not to worry about bounty hunters for a while.
Yeah. It's beautiful.
Yeah. Just be careful, and let me know if you need anything.
Yeah. Just gotta make it outta here in one piece.
Yeah. Just was hoping we'd pass through together, ya know?
Yeah. Let's get these codes to Cere.
Yeah. Let's go.
Yeah. Look at that.
Yeah. Maybe that lab on the moon will shed some light.
Yeah. Maybe.
Yeah. Me too.
Yeah. Need some information from the ruins.
Yeah. One day, I'd love to start a business of my own.
Yeah. Pretty wild.
Yeah. Promised myself not to rob, or fight, or threaten, or destroy.
Yeah. See you around.
Yeah. Stay down. 
Yeah. Stay down. 
Yeah. Still here.
Yeah. Sure, I can trust you.
Yeah. Thanks for being there and having my back.
Yeah. The Raiders found them. I'm sorry.
Yeah. The people who built all of this were really something.
Yeah. There's definitely more to her than meets the eye.
Yeah. They do.
Yeah. They were good friends. I wish you could have met them.
Yeah. Those were good times.
Yeah. Twenty years folded up really does a number on the joints.
Yeah. War is comin'.
Yeah. We been wonderin'.
Yeah. What's it to you?
Yeah. Wonder what Saw has for us next.
Yeah. Yeah I'm okay.
Yeah. Yeah! I can do that.
Yeah. Yeah, me too. I would've liked to show her around just once, ya know?
Yeah. You couldn't escape the factories, so I used to make little tunes out of the noise from them in my head.
Yeah. You leaving Koboh?
Yeah. You relieved?
Yeah. You should open a cantina.
Yeah. You should try taking detours more often.
Yeah. You take command, lead the charge. You earned it.
Yeah. You won't find it stomping around Dredger Gorge anymore.
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah... we have coffins for a reason, too.
Yeah... you better run!
Yeah...?
Yeah...but that doesn't mean I'm going to let the Empire destroy Koboh's history.
Yeah...of course. Of course.
Yeah...only good Inquisitor is a...well, you know. Look at me, turning things dark again. Sorry.
Yeah...was thinking the same thing.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah? And how long will that take?
Yeah? And why's that?
Yeah? Any advice.
Yeah? Any tips?
Yeah? Greez will love that.
Yeah? Let's see.
Yeah? Maybe I'll fix ya something. When I'm free.
Yeah? There's an open spot at the top of the raider ladder - you interested?
Years of fighting - and the Empire's just crushing more worlds.
Years of fighting...
Years of practice, plenty of rest.
Yeesh!
Yep yep!
Yep, I can vouch for that.
Yep, I'd love to get a restraining bolt for his mouth.
Yep, definitely my favorite one here.
Yep, it's just me. 
Yep, new and familiar all at the same time.
Yep. 
Yep. 
Yep. 
Yep. Still not great.
Yer askin' yerself, 'How in the deep did ol' Skoova know where the fishie was hiding?'
Yer no Lothal peach.
Yer right...yes, yer right.
Yes
Yes - Raiders are not to be trusted! Too dangerous for Garra!
Yes I will.
Yes I'm sure. Now eyes up and keep steady. 
Yes Senator.
Yes it is, how did you -
Yes it is. How did you -
Yes they do. Yes they do.
Yes we will.
Yes yes, hello.
Yes you did.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Be afraid!
Yes! Burn the chaff!
Yes! Don't let up!
Yes! Fight me!
Yes! I crave this!
Yes! Kill the beast!
Yes! More power!
Yes! Move in on him!
Yes! Power!
Yes! Resist!
Yes! Show me your power!
Yes! Show me your power. 
Yes! Show me your skill!
Yes! Strengthen yourself!
Yes! That's it!
Yes! Very much so!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, Brother.
Yes, Brother.
Yes, Cal!
Yes, Cere!
Yes, Cere!
Yes, Greez.
Yes, I believe you are right.
Yes, I did! Wini Eres, by the way. Nice to meet you, Cal. So, my datapad?
Yes, I did, Cal. 'Cause Koboh brought this partnership together. And we're not done yet.
Yes, I feel it too. It will pass with time.
Yes, I received permission from the quartermaster.
Yes, I see. 
Yes, I think so too.
Yes, I think so too.
Yes, I think so too.
Yes, I was thinking the same. Let me know if you find anything, will you?
Yes, Jedi! Again!
Yes, Master Junda!
Yes, Master. My apologies.
Yes, Sister.
Yes, Sister.
Yes, absolutely. For the glory of the Empire.
Yes, actually, I do.
Yes, and not getting shot.
Yes, and not one of us can forget our place.
Yes, and they love to take requests.
Yes, and through him they are now afforded greater importance.
Yes, and you should also survey the perimeter.
Yes, because I can kill them.
Yes, bleed...
Yes, but don't worry. You're not alone. I'll help you get back on your feet.
Yes, but my fee was nothing compared to the price they paid at the hands of a corrupt system.
Yes, but the Empire is attacking the main gate.
Yes, but there's more coming.
Yes, but we execute as we please.
Yes, but your comlink is clearly operational.
Yes, captain. Roger, roger.
Yes, cull the weak!
Yes, droid. You too.
Yes, flee coward!
Yes, get him!
Yes, good! That passion is what drives the Empire forward.
Yes, hello.
Yes, how spirited!
Yes, indeed. Most Narkis choose not to share their names with outsiders.
Yes, it continues to surprise me.
Yes, it does.
Yes, it is nice to be traveling again.
Yes, it is this way!
Yes, it's perfect!
Yes, let the bolts fly! Good!
Yes, let this combat decide your fate!
Yes, let's.
Yes, me too.
Yes, more of that!
Yes, more!
Yes, more, more!
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.
Yes, of course. But surely we can find something a bit more inspiring for our next project than a water pump.
Yes, okay. 
Yes, prolong your suffering!
Yes, quite.
Yes, regain your strength.
Yes, run. Run!
Yes, she does.
Yes, she was.
Yes, since the attack on Fortress Inquisitorius. They've been brutal, uncompromising.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. Honestly thought they were a myth until recently.
Yes, sir. Is there any idea of what the Raiders took from the wreckage?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I am prepared and ready.
Yes, sir?
Yes, suffer!
Yes, suffer!
Yes, sustain yourself.
Yes, that could work.
Yes, that spire there! It's so close, yet so far.
Yes, that suits you, noble one.
Yes, that's exactly my point.
Yes, that's it!
Yes, that's worthy of your attention.
Yes, the odds are against us.
Yes, the traitor eludes us.
Yes, then one day he simply walks into my archive. Alive and whole.
Yes, they are ancient security mechanisms. A remnant of those who came before.
Yes, they are.
Yes, trooper.
Yes, understood.
Yes, very good.
Yes, we did.
Yes, we did. And we will find it again.
Yes, we will help each other grow.
Yes, well the Empire's presence has grown these past years.
Yes, well. Anything has potential if you squint hard enough.
Yes, yes! Laughter is light. We must spread it, especially during such dark times.
Yes, yes! You've got him on the ropes now!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes, you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. 
Yes. 
Yes. Alone, I calmly walked through the darkness, trusting my intuition. I found another exit.
Yes. Alright. Got it. 
Yes. And when he does, I will destroy him.
Yes. But the experiences we carry always have a use, sojourner.
Yes. But the loss of the Coruscant Archive has forced us to seek out less traditional sources.
Yes. Cordova was exploring them until the Empire's presence grew.
Yes. Except for Rayvis.
Yes. Freak hyperspace incident - chunks of starship tearing through space at near lightspeed.
Yes. Hard to believe that fate brought us together once again after all this time.
Yes. I felt Master Cordova there, too.
Yes. I heard something similar, whatever that means.
Yes. I once saved a pilgrim from a stormtrooper not far from here.
Yes. I suppose it is 'spooky'.
Yes. I will return to the outpost at Rambler's Reach. We...had a domicile there.
Yes. Let's get out of here.
Yes. Lethal, maximum force.
Yes. Like me, he was of the Named Few. A free thinker as well.
Yes. My sisters are gone, but their wisdom remains.
Yes. No Jedi, but a holdout of traitors.
Yes. Not much I haven't encountered in my travels.
Yes. Once, she asked me what would happen if she left Koboh. I told her what any with open eyes could see.
Yes. Perhaps that would be best.
Yes. Show me your skill. 
Yes. Sir, how did this happen?
Yes. Specifically, Rayvis.
Yes. The temple is abandoned and well-fortified.
Yes. Their faces.
Yes. These are dark times. I helped those I could.
Yes. They are also ugly.
Yes. They deserve a home.
Yes. This planet is filled with all manner of fauna.
Yes. Try to resist. 
Yes. Understood. And if he doesn't come, well, least we all get to live another day, right? 
Yes. We came under constant pressure from Imperial censors to conform to their propaganda.
Yes. We have to find shelter.
Yes. Why else?
Yes. Yes, me too.
Yes. Yes, this is what I want. 
Yes. You think they give those for that?
Yes. Your model number is lower. You are subordinate.
Yes...
Yes...the little ones deserve better....
Yes?
Yes?
Yesss! Bring me destruction.
Yet how can we thrive when terrorists threaten your homes?
Yet more of you.
Yet our enemies persist.
Yet to grow tall requires a constant light source. Any amateur horticulturalist knows that!
Yet.
Yield and I'll make it quick.
Yield and I'll make it quick.
Yield!
Yield!
Yikes.
Yikes...
Yo Cal! My main man!
Yo, Kestis!
Yoohoo! Caaaal!
You - keep your sensors running.
You ARE a Jedi!
You B1s are pretty flimsy. I could upgrade you if you want.
You B2s are useless.
You B2s aren't bad as far as droids go.
You Jedi joke!
You Jedi rat!
You Jedi truly are overrated.
You Purge Troopers are an inspiration! I look forward to sharing in your exploits.
You a believer in the cause?
You absolutely do not. But okay!
You actually hit me!
You actually killed him?
You again! Just what is goin' on!
You ain't a warrior! 
You ain't the sharpest clanker, are ya?
You already know I've been working with Saw Gerrera.
You alright?
You alright?
You alright?
You alright?
You alright?
You always excelled at the art of disguise.
You always find good stuff.
You always had a green thumb, Greez.
You always loved to climb.
You and Bode seem close.
You and I are not the same.
You and I have different definitions of "alright".
You and I have different perspectives.
You and I will carry that loss for the rest of our lives.
You and droids seem to get along, don't you?
You and me at last!
You and me both!
You and me have different ideas of habitable.
You and me now, Jedi. 
You and that Nautolan are getting pretty chummy.
You and your kriffin' calculations! Just let a man dream.
You are Master Junda's friend. My thanks.
You are a Jedi.
You are a Jedi?
You are a cold and mechanical thing. But, you have your uses.
You are a coward!
You are a coward.
You are a credit to your model.
You are a curious one, Jedi.
You are a dedicated servant of the cause, yet you are disposable. It is a sad truth.
You are a frail thing.
You are a keen prey, but I'll have you! Come on!
You are a lost, lost cause.
You are a pitiful being.
You are a serious threat.
You are a skilled fighter. 
You are a threat and must be stopped.
You are a traitor and I will destroy you.
You are a true challenge. 
You are a very kind person, Greez Dritus.
You are a very odd sort.
You are a very violent individual.
You are a warrior.
You are a weakling.
You are a weakling. 
You are admirable.
You are an absolute bastion of confidence.
You are an excellent asset to the Raiders, then.
You are an odd one, aren't you?
You are armed with close-ranged weaponry for eliminating targets.
You are aware the Republic has issued a full-scale evacuation order.
You are but a novice of the Force.
You are but a pale imitation of a Jedi.
You are curious to learn more about the masked hermits helping your mentor, hmm?
You are damaged.
You are defensive.
You are done for.
You are drawn, it seems, to places of great significance.
You are elusive.
You are finished!
You are finished.
You are finished?
You are fortunate.
You are fragile things.
You are good at taking orders.
You are in violation.
You are inefficient.
You are injured.
You are injured.
You are insignificant.
You are just as intuitive as my research said!
You are located. Coward.
You are lost.
You are lucky to have droids like us for allies.
You are meaningless.
You are mine.
You are mine.
You are mine.
You are mine. 
You are mine. 
You are mistaken. Soon, I will possess all the riches a prospector could know.
You are model 459?
You are my favorite patrol partner.
You are no Jedi.
You are no threat to me.
You are no threat.
You are not as alone as you think, either.
You are not authorized.
You are not authorized.
You are not in command.
You are not invited.
You are not nice to me.
You are not the first to say so.
You are nothing.
You are nothing.
You are nothing.
You are nothing. 
You are nothing. 
You are on a roll, Cal! Got another tip for ya.
You are pathetic.
You are persistent!
You are quick.
You are quite the impressive quarry. Or is it you who is the hunter?
You are really attached to that speeder.
You are revealed, Jedi.
You are right.
You are safe with us, Kata.
You are skilled.
You are slow!
You are so small-minded...
You are so very weak. 
You are starting to understand me!
You are still doomed.
You are still doomed.
You are such a poor excuse for a soldier.
You are supposed to know.
You are testing my patience.
You are tiresome.
You are troubled.
You are truly a warrior!
You are under arrest.
You are unstoppable, Cere!
You are using the force.
You are vanquished.
You are very dedicated in your service to the Empire.
You are very stubborn.
You are weak and it is very likely you will be destroyed.
You are weak!
You are weak!
You are weak, coward.
You are weak.
You are weak.
You are weak.
You are weak.
You are weak.
You are weak. 
You are weakened.
You are weakened.
You are welcome to try.
You are wise to kneel.
You are wounded.
You are wounded.
You are wounded.
You are...correct.
You aren't going to shoot me.
You aren't leaving here alive.
You aren't quick enough. 
You aren't sneaky up there. 
You aren't sneaky, Jedi!
You aren't so skilled!
You aren't so smooth. 
You aren't so tough.
You aren't tough. 
You aren't tough. 
You aren't trying!
You as a youngling, with Master Qui-Gon as your tour guide.
You as well. Wherever I went, you were never far from my thoughts.
You asked how life was different in my day. For one, I believe we were more charitable to one another.
You associate with the Order, and you'll be hunted for the rest of your days.
You attacked me first, fair's fair. I didn't go picking a fight.
You barely even heard the plan!
You barely got me.
You bastard.
You be careful out there, and I'll be careful in here.
You been getting into fights?
You been up to the lift in the canyon yet?
You been watching me?
You been working here for a while?
You believe that?
You bet it is. All we need is a name. The Good Guys Gang!
You bet your fancy armor it would!
You bet.
You bet.
You bet.
You betcha.
You better be right about that, rookie.
You better be right. 
You better drop me.
You better get going, Cal.
You better get moving.
You better help me!
You better kill me before I break free...
You better know how to use that laser sword.
You better not be hollering about grabbing one of my nekkos again.
You better not come back!
You better not hit me with those!
You better not tell me you're one of them.
You better watch out!
You better watch where you're prospectin'.
You blasted short circuit! You're gonna get us killed!
You bleed. How human.
You blockhead, you lost him!
You blockheads won't last five seconds against a Jedi!
You bolt head, that's no battle droid. She's an old model.
You bore me!
You bore me.
You bore me.
You bore us.
You brainless bucket of bolts - you never heard the stories. No, no, I ain't goin' out here, not like that...
You braved that building full of roller mines. Where do you find the courage?
You break that. I break you.
You bring death with you, traitor.
You bring that speeder back to base yesterday?
You broke him, kriffa!
You broke it!
You broke it!
You broke it!
You broke it! You--!
You broke my jetpack!
You broke my jetpack!
You broke their guard!
You brought in a big haul huh?
You brought that droid in? Saved her too, huh?
You buckethead, you're gonna get sliced into slag in seconds.
You built something for yourself, Greez. You should be proud of that.
You buyin' or browsin'?
You call that a blaster bolt?
You call that a challenge?
You call that a shot?
You call that strength?
You call this a battle?
You call yourself a Jedi? What a disappointment.
You can always head into the wilderness and start your own town.
You can barely compete with me.
You can bet the Empire will seize most of your priorite claims.
You can bet your sweet saber he will.
You can count on me.
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do it!
You can do this.
You can do this.
You can fight the good fight and still get yours along the way, Cal. That's war.
You can fight, at least. I'll give you that.
You can fight. But can you hunt?
You can find it in a chipped cup, or a greasy hand print on a towel. They remind you someone was here.
You can find me in the archive.
You can get close, I don't mind.
You can move!
You can move, Jedi.
You can move.
You can move.
You can never be too cautious.
You can really see how a world like this would attract all sorts of people.
You can reflect, huh?
You can see how Cere's managed to evade the Empire for so long. She makes her own luck.
You can stop a bug but you can't stop me!
You can stop this anytime.
You can take a hit!
You can take a hit!
You can tell all that just from looking at it?
You can thank Greez for that. He brought 'em here on accident, is what I heard at least.
You can trust us, we're all friends here. Unlock it.
You can try.
You can work a little harder.
You can't -
You can't afford it, and I'm not a haggler.
You can't avoid us forever. 
You can't be serious. Probably some syndicate slicer.
You can't be two rancors. That's cheating.
You can't be!
You can't beat me, Cal.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me.
You can't beat the Empire!
You can't beat us all.
You can't beat us.
You can't beat us.
You can't blame them for being glad Rayvis is gone.
You can't block forever!
You can't block forever. 
You can't block forever. 
You can't block us all.
You can't borrow it, Turgle.
You can't break me. 
You can't break through.
You can't catch them all!
You can't compete.
You can't cut me up like that!
You can't defeat the Empire.
You can't defeat us all. 
You can't defeat us!
You can't ditch me.
You can't do that!
You can't do that.
You can't dodge forever!
You can't dodge me!
You can't elude me. 
You can't escape me!
You can't escape me!
You can't escape me. 
You can't escape me. 
You can't escape the Brood. 
You can't escape the Empire. 
You can't escape the Empire. 
You can't escape us!
You can't escape us. 
You can't escape your demise.
You can't escape!
You can't escape!
You can't escape.
You can't escape.
You can't escape.
You can't escape. 
You can't escape. 
You can't escape. 
You can't escape. 
You can't flee.
You can't flee.
You can't fool me! You're here for my lights! You're here to kill me - just like that gang!
You can't get away from me!
You can't get away that easy. 
You can't get away. 
You can't get away. 
You can't get away. 
You can't get away. 
You can't get far!
You can't get me. 
You can't have got far.
You can't hide down there. 
You can't hide forever.
You can't hide from me.
You can't hide from the Empire.
You can't hide, Jedi!
You can't hide, you know?
You can't hide.
You can't hide.
You can't hit me.
You can't hit me.        
You can't hold forever!
You can't hurt me.
You can't just cut through a Super Battle Droid!
You can't just take that!
You can't keep hiding!
You can't keep that up.
You can't keep this up forever.
You can't keep this up.
You can't keep this up.
You can't keep up!
You can't last!
You can't last.
You can't match me!
You can't match me.
You can't match my aerial tactics.
You can't match this!
You can't match us!
You can't miss it.
You can't miss it.
You can't overpower us.
You can't replace those capacitors!
You can't ruin this, I won't let you!
You can't run forever!
You can't run forever!
You can't run forever!
You can't run forever.
You can't run forever.
You can't run forever. 
You can't run forever. 
You can't run forever. 
You can't run forever. 
You can't run from me!
You can't run from me. 
You can't run from the Empire!
You can't run from us.
You can't say it ain't short on personality, ha!
You can't say that to us!
You can't stand against me. 
You can't stand against us. 
You can't stand against... us. 
You can't stay down there.
You can't stop me forever. 
You can't stop me!
You can't stop me.
You can't stop me.
You can't stop me.
You can't stop me.
You can't stop my rocket!
You can't stop the Brood. 
You can't stop the Brood. 
You can't stop the Empire.
You can't stop the Raiders so easily!
You can't stop this!
You can't stop this!
You can't stop this!
You can't stop this.
You can't stop this.
You can't stop this.
You can't stop us all!
You can't stop us all!
You can't stop us!
You can't stop us!
You can't stop us.
You can't survive this.
You can't think like that. We've got plenty to do here.
You can't think we can kill that!?
You can't top my skill.
You can't topple me.
You can't touch me.
You can't trust your craftsmanship to the Raiders.
You can't understand.
You can't vanquish me.
You can't win!
You can't win, traitor. 
You can't win.
You can't win.
You can't win. 
You can't...
You cannot allow them near you. You see a Jedi, you aim and fire. Don't hesitate.
You cannot alter my mind!
You cannot be dead.
You cannot be trusted to succeed. I will not fail.
You cannot block forever
You cannot block forever.
You cannot bypass this outpost.
You cannot defeat me!
You cannot defeat me!
You cannot defeat me. 
You cannot defeat the Empire!
You cannot defeat us.
You cannot dissect our purpose!
You cannot end me!
You cannot endure.
You cannot endure.
You cannot enter the laboratory...
You cannot escape me.
You cannot escape me. 
You cannot escape this.
You cannot escape!
You cannot escape!
You cannot escape!
You cannot escape.
You cannot escape.
You cannot escape.
You cannot escape.
You cannot fathom power such as this!
You cannot flee.
You cannot give up yet.
You cannot hide.
You cannot hide.
You cannot hold me!
You cannot hope to endure!
You cannot impede me.
You cannot insult me any more than a Haagust reekbeetle can insult a slumbering acklay.
You cannot last, not against me.
You cannot last.
You cannot last.
You cannot last.
You cannot match my programming.
You cannot prevail. 
You cannot resist!
You cannot run forever!
You cannot run forever. 
You cannot run.

You cannot stop us!
You cannot win like this.
You cannot win!
You cannot win!
You cannot win!
You cannot win.
You cannot win.
You cannot win. 
You cannot win. 
You cannot win. 
You care for the wellbeing of others far more than most I've met. Turgle and Zee are living proof of that.
You care to put some credits on that?
You catch that too, BD?
You catch what they were shooting at? A spy droid.
You caught me!
You caught me. 
You certainly haven't slowed down. I miss that! And not just because I could use the exercise.
You check out those rollers in the building yet?
You checked out those caverns?
You chose a hard path.
You chose the wrong stormtrooper. 
You chose well.
You clearly have a talent for this, Cal.
You comin' after my Priorite?
You coming or what?
You coming, scrapper? 
You coming?
You coming?
You coming? Crew's waiting on you slowpoke.
You commando droids think you're so much better than us.
You complain a lot. If you're not happy, why stay?
You conniving...
You could always build a second cantina.
You could be in the stormtrooper division.
You could be next!
You could be waiting a while.
You could have found a safer place to make a credit.
You could not bear the weight. It would crush you.
You could put it back on?
You could race it for credits!
You could take off your suit.
You couldn't have won. 
You couldn't have won. 
You coward!
You crossed the wrong family. 
You cut them in half!?
You damn beast!
You dare approach me?
You dare stand against me?
You dare!?
You dare?!
You defy death, but it will claim you in the end!
You demonstrate fear.
You dense? That's a Jedi. We need to close this off immediately.
You depart victorious - but soon a new challenger may appear.
You deserve this. 
You did it you three armed son of a gundark!
You did it.
You did not let him just do that.
You did well.
You did? Really?
You didn't actually think you were going to live did you?
You didn't care about those prospectors, did you? You just wanted the priorite.
You didn't care about those prospectors, did you? You just wanted the priorite.
You didn't have to step in just now, but you did.
You didn't have to take its arm off!
You didn't see this.
You didn't stand a chance.
You didn't try anything brave at that watchtower, did you?
You died!? But I had so much more pain to give!
You disgust me!
You do anything besides prospecting?
You do have a knack for getting into trouble.
You do not belong on Jedha.
You do not command me.
You do not fear my strategy? You will.
You do not fear the end, do you?
You do not scare me, traitor.
You do not scare us, traitor.
You do not wanna fall victim to a gorocco slam, I assure you.
You do not want to join the Raiders.
You do the same, Mosey.
You do, don't you? Oh Cal Kestis, not a day passes when I'm not grateful you pulled me out of that collapsed tunnel.
You do?
You do? That's kind of you.
You do?!
You doing okay, buddy?
You doing okay?
You dolts, help me!
You don't belong here.
You don't collect fish. You eat them.
You don't concern me.
You don't cook. I cook.
You don't even know what I'm offering!
You don't have enough. Perhaps another object can suffice?
You don't have the priorite. How about something else?
You don't have to be afraid.
You don't have to do this, you know.
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to tell me twice.
You don't hold back.
You don't know that. 
You don't know the half of it, Kestis.
You don't know the half of it. But yeah, you should steer clear.
You don't know what they'll do to me - to us!
You don't know. That's the beauty of it.
You don't last long in this galaxy without being strong, and a little bit ruthless.
You don't like to talk much about your past, do you Monk?
You don't look busy.
You don't look cool. You have never looked cool.
You don't look good.
You don't look like a raider.
You don't look so good.
You don't look so good.
You don't mess around, do ya?
You don't mind the sand, do you?
You don't mind us riding, do you, big guy?
You don't need to check every five minutes. There's nothing out there.
You don't say.
You don't scare me!
You don't scare me.
You don't scare me.
You don't scare me.
You don't scare me. 
You don't see it either.
You don't see that every day.
You don't seem happy here. Why stick around?
You don't stand a chance!
You don't stand a chance!
You don't stand a chance.
You don't think she went after Zee, do you?
You don't trust her with them?
You don't understand! He didn't understand either!
You don't understand, I can't just -
You don't wanna get into a brawl with a B2, let me tell you.
You don't want Kata spending her whole life in hiding, do you?
You don't want to fight me.
You don't want to keep Cere waiting, do you?
You don't want to sell these droids to Rayvis.
You don't work here, do you?
You droids are as dry as a Florrum cantina.
You droids aren't the greatest patrol partners.
You droids ever get lonely?
You droids ever get tired of all this patrolling?
You droids lack an appreciation for history. The Jedi were no joke. I'm sure you'll see.
You eating okay, keeping up your strength?
You enjoy a good fight, right droid? Punchin', aimin', blastin' - all that stuff?
You enjoy that, buddy?
You enjoying the spotlight, Bode?
You ever actually meet Rayvis?
You ever been in a ship this big before, buddy?
You ever experience a Chandrila sunset?
You ever find 'the one'?
You ever fought a Jedi before, son?
You ever fought a Jedi?
You ever get frustrated using that new arm?
You ever get homesick, Tulakt?
You ever have any close calls like that?
You ever heard anything like that before?
You ever kill a wookie?
You ever leave this booth?
You ever seen something like this, BD?
You ever take anything from base without asking?
You ever take apart a Lucrehulk in your scrapper days?
You ever think about taking trips off world, Turgle?
You ever think of retiring?
You ever thought about having kids?
You ever tried a droid companion?
You ever try fishing?
You ever visit that holy city they got here?
You ever wanna talk, Cal, I'm here for you.
You ever want to travel to Coruscant, see what it's like?
You ever wish you were an organic, like me?
You ever wonder what your life might've been like if you weren't a Jedi?
You expect this to yield victory!?
You face the magick of Dathomir!
You failed your friends. You'll fail yourself.
You failed.
You failed.
You failure!
You falter.
You fear death.
You fear me, don't you?
You fear me.
You fear us.
You feel a connection to this garden.
You feel like saying that again, clanker?
You fellas get the yacht down, Jetpack.
You felt that!
You fight dirty, Jedi.
You fight well!
You figured right.
You finish off that mogu?
You flazin' Jedi!
You flee?! Coward!
You follow your orders, that's good. Hopefully you'll go far.
You fool.
You fool.
You fought well.
You fought well.
You found Mookie.
You found a jelly spire I see!
You found a real one?!
You found him in the shipyards?
You found some treasure? Can't hide it!
You from the Core?
You get a good look at that structure?
You get into a lot of trouble, don't you?
You get my invite to Pyloon's?
You get their attention, I'll flank 'em.
You give that old tech Cal found in the lab a look?
You glad to be back?
You go ahead, Cal. I'm sure the crew can't wait to hear the news.
You go get him!
You go in before me, you understand? You before me.
You gonna check it out?
You gonna disobey a direct command?
You gonna lead it?
You gonna let him call you that?
You good, BD?
You good?
You got a confident gait. I like that.
You got a favorite food?
You got a jetpack, use it.
You got a name, Jedi?
You got a spare pick on ya?
You got an arm guy?
You got any priorite on ya?
You got anything to eat around here?
You got credits to spare?
You got ferrocrete ears, scum, or just a death wish?
You got it!
You got it!
You got it!
You got it, Ashe.
You got it, Zygg.
You got it, boy!
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it.
You got it. Well, sometimes I fidget. I also have problems with attention. It's actually-
You got it? Take that, Imperials! How about I whip up something special to celebrate?
You got its attention.
You got me!
You got me!
You got more spite in you than some con-men I've known!
You got nice eyes, Cal, but you ain't the type I'd cross without expecting payback.
You got no guts.
You got no respect for workmanship!
You got no spine!
You got no stomach for this.
You got out. I'm glad you did.
You got overwatch? 
You got skill.
You got some nerve!
You got something to say, say it!
You got something to say? Say it to my face.
You got spark!
You got that right!
You got that right.
You got the priorite, I've got the product.
You got the stuff? I got the goods.
You got this, buddy!
You got this.
You got us to the senator.
You got your detonators ready to go?
You gotta die. That's what the weak do.
You gotta hand it to Khri. She thought of everything.
You gotta hear it to believe it.
You gotta know when to walk away from a rigged game!
You gotta learn to relax, man.
You had better get him - I don't want to explain another failure to command.
You had no chance.
You had no chance.
You hand it over, or I will put you down.
You handle that blaster well.
You harm a hair on Kata's head, and I'll make sure Cere Junda stays hidden forever.
You hate tea. You're just trying to get my mind off the moon. Well it won't work.
You hate them.
You have a 0.3% probability of defeating me in a melee encounter.
You have a Purge Trooper with you now. We're trained for this.
You have a blaster too?
You have a blaster? Hah.
You have a good night.
You have a particular skillset, then.
You have a point.
You have always been a battle droid. Your purpose has always been battle.
You have an admirable passion, trooper, but do not let your zeal outpace your ability.
You have an odd disposition.
You have associates?
You have been caught harboring a traitor.
You have been here before?
You have been injured.
You have been to Coruscant before, Greez, yes?
You have both a blaster and a blade.
You have credits to bet?
You have demonstrated great bravery and wisdom in the face of overwhelming adversity.
You have done enough.
You have done well by the Code.
You have eyes on?
You have failed.
You have friends, how about that!
You have gathered the remnants of the Jedi tradition.
You have grown stronger.
You have honored yourself, Jedi.
You have insufficient discs. A mistake, I'm sure.
You have made quite a name for yourself.
You have more songs to bring me, Cal, they're waiting!
You have no chance.
You have no hope!
You have no idea how much they cost!
You have no idea how valuable this woman is.
You have no idea what you've set in motion!
You have no power here.
You have not downed this droid!
You have not seen the true extent of my powers, Cal Kestis.
You have nothing to fear.
You have outlived your use to me.
You have played...perfectly.
You have plenty of time to think about it.
You have power.
You have proven yourself.
You have shown some tenacity, so far.
You have smothered their fire.
You have some training.
You have some water damage on your chassis.
You have somewhere to be? Very well. But return later.
You have to admit, that's not bad.
You have to deal with me now, Jedi. 
You have to look after them when you find them!
You have to mess up.
You have weakened.
You have witnessed much of our desert, noble Jedi.
You have your orders.
You have your training. Trust it. 
You haven't gotten away yet.
You haven't had your beauty sleep in months.
You haven't hit a target in two weeks.
You haven't hit a thing since we've been out here.
You haven't learned to fly yet, have you?
You haven't lost your edge.
You haven't lost your edge.
You haven't lost your touch.
You haven't trained enough.
You headin' up the mountain?
You heading to the cantina anytime soon?
You hear lots of things. It worries me.
You hear someone killed a rancor?
You hear something out there?
You hear that, about a Jedi? Feels like the net's closing in on us.
You hear that?
You hear that? Oh no!
You hear that? Stay alert.
You hear that?! Think that Jedi came back to finish us off?
You hear there's a gorocco stalking around Dredger Gorge?
You heard him - don't dawdle, create a perimeter!
You heard right.
You heard that, right?
You helped me realize I wasn't alone.
You hesitate!
You hiding from me? Ha!
You hit your head or something?
You hurry back.
You in?
You interested in adventure?
You interested in the opportunity of a lifetime?
You interested in the opportunity of a lifetime?
You just can't help yourself, can you? I'm not gonna be around to save you next time.
You just come back safe and sound. And I'll keep things humming along in the meantime.
You just come from Dredger Gorge? And still walkin', huh?
You just got lucky.
You just got slammed!
You just keep walking!
You just let me know when you're ready to go.
You just stay back and let me deal with the Jedi - I'm ready for anything!
You just weren't cut out for this.
You keep your head in a fight - I like that.
You keepin' on Doma's good side, friend?
You kept me waiting, Jedi! Dagan Gera chose me to end your pathetic little life.
You kept me waiting, Jedi.
You kiddin' me?
You kidding me!?
You kidding me!?
You kidding me, Cal?
You kidding me?
You kidding me?
You kidding me?
You kidding me?
You kidding me?
You kidding me? It's all just noise.
You kidding me? We're like moss on stone.
You kidding? That guy is as sharp as they come.
You killed Master Cordova!
You knew Dagan Gera before he woke on Koboh, no?
You know Bramlik can still see, even though they have no eyes.
You know Cere, I named a very special drink after you back at my saloon.
You know Greez and I are friends, right?
You know I do, Cal
You know I have other customers, right?
You know I once had dreams about being a bounty hunter.
You know I'd love to indulge you Caij, but you are hankering for the good stuff.
You know I'm right.
You know a good deal when you see it.
You know any good tunes, to pass the time?
You know any others?
You know anything about the High Republic settlement off towards the swamps?
You know boss, I was starting to think that Cal Kestis of yours was just a fabrication!
You know check-ins are standard procedure here! This is our biggest assignment yet, don't risk losing it!
You know everyone gotten so cheery, but they've forgotten one important detail.
You know how he is about mess.
You know how it is.
You know how much that cost?
You know it feels good not to be the target for once.
You know it!
You know it's not often I break out an old family recipe like this.
You know just where to look.
You know me so well.
You know me, I'll stab 'em in the side when they're distracted. Gets the job done.
You know nothing of the Force.
You know nothing of the Force.
You know nothing of the Force.
You know one?
You know really what stinks? That attitude.
You know the deal: stick to the plan, stick to the plan.
You know the stories they'll tell about this? You'll be a part of that, a little.
You know there was a time when - I remember that -
You know they'll never allow themselves to rest if you're in danger.
You know this is pointless.
You know this place makes me nervous.
You know this won't improve your aim, right?
You know we're supposed to split everything we find, right?
You know what I like about plants? When you talk to them, they can't just walk away!
You know what I like about you, Cal? You're not always bugging me to step in and help ya solve disputes and whatnot.
You know what I think? The purpose of pilgrimage is to test one's resolve.
You know what this place needs?
You know what to do.
You know what you fight for. And you're not afraid of a challenge.
You know what you need. Take it.
You know what, Greez?
You know what, I think I should stay here. Make myself useful.
You know what? I am going to try and get in touch with the others who were expelled.
You know what? Sure. Knock yourself out, go poke it.
You know why, old man. My leg's no good!
You know you can't escape!
You know you can't fool me, right?
You know you can't get away?
You know you're gonna buy it, so just buy it.
You know your stuff!
You know your way around Koboh, don't you?
You know, Cal, I think my recent brush with the Raiders has rather altered my perspective.
You know, Cal, just when I thought you couldn't find a worse place for us to go.
You know, Greez...
You know, I broke into a freighter on Denab once.
You know, I came here for a change of pace. Now we got a Star Destroyer lurking overhead.
You know, I didn't do too bad with this place.
You know, I don't mind you droids. You ain't so bad.
You know, I don't think you did all that bad a job looking after the Mantis.
You know, I have to admit that you've got a genius little business scheme going.
You know, I never thought you'd end up as a librarian, Cere.
You know, I read an interesting myth about the Jedi.
You know, I think it is the same reason that people are flocking to Pyloon's Saloon.
You know, I used to run a very instructive seminar, very exclusive - for a modest consultancy fee, of course.
You know, I was programmed to lead.
You know, I'm a nature lover myself. I keep a few of the tamer critters in the Outpost stables.
You know, I'm feeling...nostalgic. I last spoke to Master Khri two hundred years ago -
You know, I've been dreaming of this day!
You know, Mosey is one strong woman.
You know, Skoova invited me to go fishing. I told him yes - on one condition.
You know, for a droid, you have very little spark. See, that's your problem.
You know, in a way you're actually right.
You know, most folk just congratulate me.
You know, not long ago I would've argued the Republic was just as flawed as the Empire, in its own way.
You know, not long back I flew one of those T-16s for the first time.
You know, the fall of the Jedi is an excellent example of how you can find purpose through chaos.
You know, the longer you rest, the longer it will take to reach Cere's base.
You know, them Jedi used to be the power in this galaxy, now there's barely any left. Kinda sad, really.
You know, there's a fish tank down at Pyloon's Saloon that could use some attention.
You know, this drill was originally designed by the Separatists as an assault craft.
You know, this isn't our first encounter.
You know, this mountain was one of the first locations on Koboh to attract prospectors.
You know, we solder on some better converters, and we could double the price.
You know, we'd be a lot more secure in this position with a couple of Purge Troopers for backup.
You know, when I first came to Koboh, I was ready to throw the towel in.
You know, when I first met that old bucket of bolts, I thought Zee was trouble, but she ain't half bad.
You know, you remind me of prospector, what was his name, Gulu?
You know, you shouldn't worry about Zee.
You know, you're right. We should!
You know, you've got a Core World air about you. It's becoming.
You know...keeping things secure. Secure for the Empire. The Empire's security.
You know...you might actually be right for once.
You know?
You kriffin' scum - I gotta fix that mess!
You lack accuracy.
You lack confidence.
You lack confidence.
You lack conviction. 
You lack discipline. 
You lack finesse!
You lack finesse. 
You lack focus.
You lack focus.
You lack strength.
You lack sufficient discs. A pity.
You lack the requisite skill!
You lack training.
You lack true power!
You learned to fly though, yes?
You leave a sloppy trail.
You leave much to be desired.
You leave the Jedi to me. I have been longing for this fight.
You left a whole pile of juicy, cybernetic bits in your wake.
You let him get away!
You let me walk my own path.
You like it here, don't you?
You like to fish?
You little-!
You look a little busted.
You look as shiny as fresh priorite.
You look familiar.
You look familiar.
You look hurt. Just give up. 
You look like a coward.
You look like a coward.
You look like a droid.
You look like trouble.
You look nice
You look nice today.
You look nice, Skoova.
You look peaceful when you do that.
You look ready for the scrap pile.
You look small. 
You look small. 
You look smaller from up here.
You look spent.
You look tired, take a load off.
You look weak, Jedi. 
You look...feeble.
You lost a friend, Dana. You do not have to just dust that off.
You lost!
You lost, stranger?
You lost?
You made a big mistake, Jedi!
You made a big mistake. 
You made a mistake coming here. 
You made a mistake!
You made a mistake. 
You made it.
You made it.
You made me do this.
You make a new friend, BD?
You make certain there are none!
You make friends pretty easily, huh?
You make me sick!
You make yourself easy prey. Shame.
You may be more useful in death...
You may have downed a big one, but there's a lot of players in the game who still want you dead.
You may not be prepared for the challenges to come, but I am.
You may not enter, Jedi. Please return to the Archive.
You may recall that I had a vision foretelling the fall of the Order.
You may tell Greez this too. He does not like it here.
You mean Zee?
You mean that time she almost burned the ship down?
You mean that?
You mean there's more than the pie?
You mean we're going to convince him to join the Raiders?
You mean, how the left side of the cabin couch completely has lost its bounce? Yeah, I noticed.
You mentioned a vow of anonymity before.
You mentioned the Golden Skriton. Anything else I should keep an eye out for?
You mentioned your last job was distasteful.
You might be, sure...
You might make a decent bounty hunter.
You might not be wearing the proper attire, but...
You might reconsider your abilities.
You might say we shared a rebellious streak.
You might want to head there too. It's dangerous out here.
You might want to leave before Greez gets second thoughts. I imagine he's nervous to hop in the pilot's seat again.
You mind running diagnostics while I transmit the intel?
You miserable fool.
You missed a spot.
You missed the Mantis, huh?
You missed!
You missed!
You missed.
You missed.
You missed. 
You monsters!
You mostly stayed on the Mantis.
You move fast.
You move too slowly!
You moved.
You murdered your fellow Jedi.
You murderous Jedi scum!
You must be Jo the Cannibal.
You must be Kata.
You must be a Jedi.
You must be a Jedi.
You must be crazy to go up there, but I don't know much.
You must be defeated.
You must be destroyed!
You must be happy that Merrin joined the crew.
You must be joking.
You must be kidding me.
You must be prepared every day to face down enemies of the galaxy!
You must be scared.
You must be strong for the task ahead!
You must be sure your equipment is ready at all times, there's a Jedi in the area.
You must comply.
You must desire further punishment.
You must die.
You must die.
You must focus on what is different. That is how you will not get lost.
You must not fall!
You must stay standing.
You must want Tanalorr very badly. But how far would you go, I wonder.
You need a tune-up.
You need all the help you can get.
You need any assistance in your ventures?
You need dressing down.
You need it around here.
You need more scrolls for that.
You need more training!
You need more training. 
You need practice. 
You need to concern yourself with more important matters.
You need to do better than that.
You need to do better than that.
You need to get a grip.
You need to heal!
You need to stop him!
You need your personality banks flushed.
You needed it more than me.
You never forget, huh? I'm on it.
You never give up hope, do ya buddy?
You never give up.
You never know where an enemy is gonna come from in a place like this.
You never know, trooper. It might.
You never learn.
You never learn.
You never miss a chance, do you?
You never seen a lightsaber up close. If you had, maybe you wouldn't be in such a rush to see one again.
You never should have crossed the Raiders.
You never should have crossed us.
You never told me where you're from, Bode.
You noticed, huh?
You noticed, huh?
You now!
You okay there?
You okay, Cal?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay?
You okay? Nothing broken?
You once said it wasn't the weapon that makes you a Jedi.
You only delay me.
You only delay the inevitable.
You only delay your death!
You only delay your death.
You only delay your defeat.
You only delay your destruction. 
You only delay your end. 
You only delay your fate!
You only delay. 
You only prolong this. 
You only slow it down.
You ought to introduce yourself.
You oughta keep an ear to the ground, kid. News like this doesn't find itself!
You owe me a jetpack.
You pale before Dagan Gera.
You picked the wrong fight.
You possess a fervor that the other droids do not. I like this. You will do well.
You probably fought in the Clone Wars as a child soldier, right?
You prolong the inevitable.
You prolong the inevitable.
You prolong the inevitable.
You pulled off a heist?
You put sand in my mining boots!
You ran? That doesn't sound like you were a particularly good soldier.
You ready for this, brother?
You ready for this?
You ready to clear out some riffraff, stormtrooper?
You ready to die?
You ready to fight, Jedi?
You ready to move?
You ready, Cal?
You ready, Cal? We're almost there.
You ready, droid? Ready to tear down some Jedi?
You ready?
You ready?
You ready?
You really didn't have to prove anything - but that was impressive.
You really do look terrible.
You really don't have to.
You really don't like it, do ya?
You really have ice in your circuits.
You really know your drinks.
You really think anyone got past Dagan?
You really think it'll be that easy?
You really think so?
You really think the Jedi will come back this way?
You really think they'd try assaulting an Imperial vessel?
You really think you can find all that?
You really think you can tame one?
You reek of fear.
You reek of weakness!
You rely on stims.
You removed it?
You rest too much.
You return.
You returned in one piece.
You rise to defend the Empire, or you die. Those are the only options.
You rode a piasa?
You ruined my favorite part.
You runnin' from me?
You rush in, you get sliced.
You said it, Zee.
You said that Cere gave you the money to open your saloon, yes?
You said that last week!
You said the ghost is here?
You said there's a spare gyro around here somewhere?
You saved me!
You saved my life on Bracca.
You saved my neck!
You saw that too... right?
You saw the intel.
You say that every mission. 
You scared me.
You scrap anything useful out here?
You scum!
You scum!
You scum!
You see 'em yet?
You see 'em?
You see - we're more alike than you think.
You see a Jedi - you do what?
You see all that in your ancient trinkets?
You see any credits? Those are mine!
You see any walkers?
You see anything weird in the valley? DD-EC's picking up some unusual static.
You see him?
You see it too.
You see something move back there, rookie?
You see something?
You see that garden on top of Pyloon's?
You see that scary looking woman in Pyloon's?
You see that stinkin' Jedi, you get between us, you hear?
You see that?
You see that?
You see that?
You see the commotion on the mountain?
You see this, BD?
You see what he did to that BX's leg!?
You see what he just did?
You see? Nobody can stop us.
You seek death? Very well, we shall deliver!
You seem a calculatin' sort!
You seem a decent sort, Cal.
You seem agitated, Sister. A new acquisition, perhaps?
You seem different in here, Cal.
You seem eager.
You seem fine, though?
You seem green, trooper. Are you green?
You seem hurt.
You seem in a good mood.
You seem in good spirits!
You seem nervous.
You seem pretty put together, Greez.
You seem stressed.
You seem to appreciate this.
You seem to have...miscounted your datadiscs.
You seem to know your Imperial tactics.
You seem troubled.
You seem uncertain.
You seen those beams in the sky?
You sent him alone?
You sent him alone?
You serious?
You shall fall.
You shall know pain.
You shall not escape me this time.
You shall not escape us!
You shall pay.
You shall trouble us no longer!
You shine like the stars. Oh, ahaha, that's a Coruscant saying. Perhaps a more simple 'thank you, Cal'.
You should ask Master Cordova.
You should avoid the Raiders. Scrapping is dangerous, but they're worse.
You should be able to beat one human!
You should be dead, Jedi.
You should be more patient.
You should be ready for any threat, at any time.
You should become a Purge Trooper with that confidence. I know I'd feel safer.
You should check it out if you get a chance, though.
You should check out the Koboh system. Everything grows there.
You should comply.
You should fear me.
You should focus your energies on the Jedi.
You should have cut a deal.
You should have seen your face. Complete shock.
You should have taken me on first.
You should mention that to Greez. I'm sure he'd appreciate the vote of confidence.
You should never have come!
You should not be able to do that!
You should not be here.
You should not expose your weaknesses to the Jedi. Do not even say them out loud.
You should not have come here.
You should open the door.
You should run from this squadron.
You should run now.
You should run. Now!
You should see the Shadowlands of Kashyyyk, now that's a swamp.
You should see the other guys.
You should shoot!
You should talk to Greez, maybe he can whip something up that reminds you of home.
You should try sleeping outside. See the stars.
You should turn back.
You should use more salt.
You should write that on the side of the saloon.
You should've stayed out of this.
You should've thought of that before you made a scene.
You should. It is superior.
You shouldn't be here. No, no, too close.
You shouldn't have crossed us. 
You shouldn't have done that to my equipment.
You shouldn't have done that!
You shouldn't have done that!
You shouldn't have followed us.
You show great determination, it will take you far.
You show no mercy!
You show the kind of passion that will see the Empire overcome any threat.
You showed me true power to the end!
You simply never stood a chance.
You slime.
You slippery little - !
You smell like a Gorocco!
You smell that too, BD?
You smell that, scum? That's Imperial air you're breathing.
You smell that?
You snake! Stop lurking down there. 
You son of a mynock!
You sound like a stormtrooper.
You sound real angry. Is it in your programming to be like that?
You sound surprised.
You speak eel?
You spot that crater as we were coming in?
You started early, then.
You stay away from Rayvis too, y'hear?
You stay off mine.
You stay off my land.
You stay safe now.
You stick to the plan, don't you droid? Think I worked on you myself.
You sticking around Koboh with everything going on?
You sticking around, Dana?
You still hanging around here? Get to Armias before the Empire does.
You still have no chance.
You still have to beat me.
You still here? I thought you were heading off into the desert.
You still seem frustrated by it.
You strike me as the type who sleeps with one eye open.
You super droids served mightily in the Clone Wars.
You sure are fast.
You sure he's up there?
You sure it's not your cooking?
You sure like standing and staring at me don't you.
You sure speak strange, friend. But I hope you're right.
You sure this is our bounty?
You sure you need my help?
You sure you want to push that button?
You sure you're a Jedi?
You sure you're a Jedi?
You sure you're a Jedi?
You sure you're ready to leave Pyloon's behind?
You sure?
You sure?
You sure? It could get bad out here.
You surpassed my wildest expectations.
You survived so long 'cos you were in mothballs until Rayvis found you. Nice and safe in your big ship.
You survived! How!?
You take care of that?
You take too much pleasure in killing.
You takes contraband! Garra gets rid of rest. Too risky for keeps.
You talk a lot about ripping things apart.
You talk to Doma lately?
You talking about me, Greez?
You talking about yourself again?
You taught me what it truly means to be a Jedi.
You telegraph yourself.
You telegraph yourself.
You there! 
You there! Approach slowly!
You there! Come here!
You there! Get over here!
You there! Identify yourself!
You there! Present yourself!
You there! Stop!
You there! Yes, you, my boy! Would you kindly assist us?
You there! You don't look like a friend of the Bedlam Raiders.
You there. Approach.
You there. Come here. 
You there. Come here. 
You think Cordova can repair that compass?
You think Dagan found the compass already?
You think I can do that, BD?
You think I'll see any action while I'm stationed here?
You think Kata will be alright?
You think Kata would like to see a spamel?
You think Merrin's got any magick tricks that'll ward off bad luck?
You think Zee's trouble?
You think he doesn't already know?
You think he'll come this way?
You think he's got the stuff if the Bedlam Raiders come back looking for more trouble?
You think he's real? I thought it might be a training drill.
You think he's still alive?
You think hyperspace whiplash is a joke? Sit down before we drop in.
You think our purpose is to stay here forever? Oh no, not us.
You think people would pay for that?
You think she'd ever teach me to hunt like that?
You think so?
You think so?
You think so?
You think so? Hey!
You think that scares me?!
You think that sword makes you special, Jedi?
You think the Force can save you?
You think the Force is going to scare me?
You think the Mantis can handle the journey?
You think the Raiders have what it takes to rule this place?
You think their interpretation of the Force could have been transfigured over the course of a single decade?
You think they're going to launch an attack?
You think they're here to investigate us for poor performance.
You think this Jedi served in the Clone Wars?
You think this substance has anything to do with the Array?
You think we mighta been a little hard on our old buddy?
You think we'll let you destroy us?!
You think we're safe here?
You think you can fix it?
You think you can just vanish? No.
You think you can outplay me?
You think you can run?
You think you can take me?
You think you can take on a Jedi with that blaster?
You think you're ready for whatever's lurking in the shadows?
You think you're tough just because you stood up to a rancor?
You think you're tough?
You think you're up for it?
You think your work ethic makes you special?
You think yourself a survivor but you are a failure!
You thought you could run?
You too Cal. See you soon!
You too, Cal. Good luck. Perhaps I will still be here when you return.
You too, Mosey.
You too, Zee.
You too, desert ghost.
You too.
You too.
You too.
You too.
You too.
You too. Is this the home you were talking about?
You too. Stay safe, Toa.
You too...
You took a wrong turn, I think.
You took out all the flame troopers.
You took out all the gunners!
You took out every ranged unit!
You tore that thing apart!
You track down those missing prospectors yet?
You trained for that?
You trust Monk with the saloon?
You try knocking?
You try!
You try, you try, but you won't stop me!
You trying to insult me?
You two are alive!
You two are good friends, huh?
You two are looking sour as usual.
You two find a bite to eat yet?
You two getting your fortune read?
You two go that far back, eh?
You two have that in common.
You two have too much time on your hands.
You two know each other?
You two making any progress?
You two okay?
You two still care about each other?
You two thinking of taking off?
You underestimate me!
You underestimate my power!
You understand me? Not a word!
You understand the mission, this is good. Remain alert.
You understand.
You used the Force, you're Cal Kestis!
You useless bucket of bolts - listen to your superiors!
You useless pest!
You venture into those caverns yet? Won't go myself, but you seem like you can handle a few raiders.
You walked away when you needed to. I know you'll pick it back up in no time.
You walked into that.
You wanna come with?
You wanna do that again?
You wanna find out just how real?
You wanna fly this thing?
You wanna get a bite after our shift?
You wanna go another round?
You wanna go for a hike, fine by me - I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna keep going?
You wanna know what's up there? I'll tell you:
You wanna talk to him, go for it.
You wanna trade your life for some gilded ideal, I can't stop ya. But Grock, he went out like like a champ.
You want a bogling on the Mantis?
You want a chance?
You want a ride, BD?
You want a shot at him?
You want a shot at him?
You want me to fly the Mantis through a ship-eating nebula,
You want some company today?
You want to end up like him?
You want to handle this?
You want to press it, right?
You want to protect me.
You want to reattach that!?
You wanted to play this game, Caij.  This is your reward.
You wanted to play, let's play.
You waste energy!
You waste my time.
You waste time.
You waste time.
You waste your time!
You went after Soont Madas. Remind me not to mess with you.
You went home?
You went through a lot. I'm glad you're okay, Skoova.
You were a Jedi Knight before you betrayed our order.
You were a Jedi?
You were a tax collector? Sounds pretty legitimate so far.
You were actually inside the thermal housing?! Then why weren't you cooked alive? Wait, don't tell me.
You were almost late to your patrol. Up late?
You were always going to lose. 
You were always weak, Cal.
You were always weak.
You were an old model in a new universe. Simple as that.
You were listening to me?
You were lying to us from the very start.
You were never truly a Jedi.
You were no match.
You were on Coruscant?
You were open.
You were out of position!
You were right. It's not safe here anymore. What if the Empire attacks?
You were too good for this world, Cal.
You were watching my hands during landing? That's creepy.
You were watching?
You were weak!
You were weak. I'm strong. That's how it goes.
You weren't all that.
You weren't all that.
You will address me as Captain.
You will all die here.
You will be a useful asset in battle against the enemy.
You will be a useful pawn.
You will be apprehended.
You will be caught.
You will be crushed.
You will be crushed.
You will be defeated.
You will be finished, by my hand.
You will be found.
You will be found.
You will be found.
You will be terminated.
You will be the first to be destroyed.
You will become dust in the cosmos!
You will believe what you are ordered to believe.
You will break.
You will break.
You will die by my hands.
You will die here!
You will die!
You will die.
You will die.
You will die. 
You will drop me. Now. 
You will fail today as you once failed your Padawan.
You will fail.
You will fall before me!
You will fall here!
You will fall to me.
You will fall to the power of the dark side.
You will fall!
You will fall.
You will fall.
You will fall.
You will fall.
You will fall.
You will fall.
You will fall. 
You will fall. 
You will find it in the southern desert. May it bring you clarity.
You will find no safe purchase with me!
You will find the enemy down below. 
You will find your path, Sojourner. Have patience.
You will find your strength, or I will kill you here.
You will give me access to the terminal.
You will give me access to your terminal.
You will give me the honor of victory - now, or later.
You will halt!
You will have a good death!
You will have glory, but no more!
You will know only ruin.
You will know pain.
You will learn. Do you know how trees grow?
You will leave the relics here.
You will let me go.
You will likely find out.
You will lower the shield.
You will make this garden truly great.
You will never escape.
You will never understand.
You will not block me now. 
You will not break me. 
You will not defeat me. 
You will not defeat the Empire!
You will not deny me. 
You will not escape again. 
You will not escape me. 
You will not escape this. 
You will not escape.
You will not escape. 
You will not escape. 
You will not get between me and my prey.
You will not get far.
You will not last long in the reckonings to come.
You will not stop me.
You will not survive in single combat with them. But I will take them apart.
You will not survive. 
You will not win, Jedi. 
You will not win. 
You will pay for this.
You will pay for this. 
You will pay!
You will pay.
You will pay.
You will perish!
You will perish, traitor!
You will perish.
You will provide heavy ranged and artillery support, I will engage the target directly.
You will regret that.
You will regret that.
You will remain.
You will scour this place for anything of note.
You will shatter like the moon below us!
You will shatter!
You will still die.
You will still die.
You will submit to me!
You will suffer for this!
You will suffer more, then.
You will suffer!
You will suffer!
You will suffer.
You will suffer.
You will tire. I will not.
You will too.
You will yield!
You wiped out their ranged units.
You with the Raiders?
You won in the end.
You won't be saying that if we stumble on a nest of goroccos.
You won't be when I tell you what I need for the ritual.
You won't beat me.
You won't beat us.
You won't block this.
You won't break me.
You won't break through.
You won't catch everything.
You won't catch me.
You won't catch me.

You won't escape again!
You won't escape me!
You won't escape me.
You won't escape me. 
You won't escape me. 
You won't escape me. 
You won't escape me. 
You won't escape so easily.
You won't escape the Brood.
You won't escape the Brood.
You won't escape this!
You won't escape!
You won't escape!
You won't escape.
You won't escape.
You won't escape.
You won't escape. 
You won't fool me with that.
You won't get another chance at that!
You won't get away again. 
You won't get away from me!
You won't get away that easy.
You won't get away up there.
You won't get away with that!
You won't get away!
You won't get away!
You won't get away!
You won't get away!
You won't get away!
You won't get away.

You won't get away. 
You won't get away. 
You won't get far!
You won't get far, Jedi.
You won't get far.
You won't get me like that droideka!
You won't get me like that.
You won't get me like that.
You won't get me!

You won't land another.
You won't last long.
You won't last long.
You won't last long.
You won't last long.
You won't last long.
You won't last.
You won't live forever. 
You won't prevail!
You won't rip my limbs off!
You won't see me coming.
You won't see me coming.
You won't shoot me!
You won't slip away!
You won't slip away. 
You won't stop me!
You won't stop me!
You won't stop me!
You won't stop me.
You won't stop me.
You won't stop me. 
You won't stop us!
You won't strike me. 
You won't strike me. 
You won't survive this!
You won't survive this!
You won't survive!
You won't survive.
You won't take my head.
You won't take my leg, Jedi
You won't.
You worry about the Array, whatever that is. We'll handle the Mantis.
You worry too much - it's going to be fun! A real challenge!
You worry too much.
You would have known. They carry a trail of destruction in their wake.
You would? Well, that's very decent of you.
You wouldn't beat us!
You wouldn't believe the kinda credits some of these elite types will pay for that crap.
You wouldn't catch me being bossed around like that.
You wouldn't dare!
You wouldn't dare.
You wouldn't know what to do with him if you found him.
You wouldn't turn down the opportunity of a lifetime, would you?
You wretch!
You!
You!
You!
You!
You!
You!
You!
You!
You! Come here!
You! Come here!
You! Come here!
You! Come here!
You! End him!
You! Get back!
You! Get over here!
You! Get up here and attack!
You! Get up here. 
You! Identify yourself!
You! Intruder! Halt!
You! Move up and attack!
You! Move!
You! Stop!
You! Stop!
You! Stop!
You! Stop!
You! Stop!
You! You there! Come here!
You'd better get used to sand in your helmet.
You'd better run!
You'd have liked it, Shana...
You'd have no chance.
You'd have to be moving awfully fast to pass through that gust.
You'd like that one.
You'd need three bodyguards to keep Turgle safe.
You'd never make it in the fighting pits!
You'd perish if you stayed.
You'd probably get lost in your dreamy reflection and fly us straight into trouble...
You'd really trust a droid?
You'd think so, wouldn't you? But I'm actually sad. It almost feels like I killed him.
You'd think, but the guy shorted us on our cut after a big take.
You'll be alright, Greez.
You'll be back!
You'll be back.
You'll be back. 
You'll be done soon.
You'll be fine. Just don't go making anymore shady deals.
You'll be found.
You'll be mine!
You'll be no match for me, Jedi!
You'll be okay.
You'll be smashed.
You'll be sorry for firing at me.
You'll be sorry when I'm free!
You'll be sorry!
You'll be sorry.
You'll break!
You'll break!
You'll burn for this.
You'll die a fool.
You'll die by my hand.
You'll die for this!
You'll die like the rest of your pathetic kind.
You'll die like the rest!
You'll do nothing and follow orders.
You'll fall like the rest!
You'll fall to my blade yet.
You'll fall.
You'll fatigue.
You'll fatigue.
You'll feel this!
You'll feel this.
You'll find no escape up there...
You'll get used to it.
You'll go down easy!
You'll go no further, Imperials.
You'll have to be more specific.
You'll have to come down!
You'll have to come down!
You'll have to do better.
You'll have to explain that one.
You'll have to forgive me, Cal, but I'm deep in thought at the moment. Another time, shall we?
You'll have to forgive the more tasteless ornaments.
You'll have to pick up the slack!
You'll have to try harder!
You'll have to try harder.
You'll have to try harder.
You'll have to try harder. 
You'll have to try harder. 
You'll have to try harder. 
You'll let your guard down soon. 
You'll need more than that!
You'll need more than that.
You'll need more than that.
You'll need more than that.
You'll need more'n that!
You'll need that laser sword to fight me, Jedi.
You'll need that lightsaber to fight me, Jedi.
You'll need to do better than that!
You'll need to do more than that.
You'll need to try harder. 
You'll never catch me taking orders like that. No way. Not me.
You'll never escape me. 
You'll never escape.
You'll never get through that hide - find the weak spots!
You'll never set foot on Tanalorr!
You'll never stop the Brood. 
You'll never survive by moping.
You'll never take the monastery!
You'll pay for that jetpack.
You'll pay for that!
You'll pay for that!
You'll pay for that!
You'll pay for that, Jedi.
You'll pay for that, Jedi.
You'll pay for that.
You'll pay for that.
You'll pay for that. 
You'll pay for that. 
You'll pay for that. Dearly. 
You'll pay for that...
You'll pay for this treason!
You'll pay for this!
You'll pay for this, Cal Kestis.
You'll pay for this.
You'll pay for your crimes to the Empire.
You'll pay for your insolence!
You'll pay when I find you. 
You'll pay when I'm free. 
You'll pay!
You'll pay!
You'll pay!
You'll pay! 
You'll pay.
You'll regret keeping me grounded.
You'll regret running from us, Jedi.
You'll regret that!
You'll regret that.
You'll regret that.
You'll regret that.
You'll regret this.
You'll regret this. 
You'll remember this one.
You'll run out of stims soon. 
You'll sing a different tune when your belly button starts rubbing a blister on your backbone.
You'll slip eventually.
You'll slip up.
You'll slip up.
You'll slip up.
You'll slip up.
You'll slip. They always do.
You'll soon slip up. 
You'll suffer for invading our home!
You'll suffer for that, Jedi scum.
You'll suffer for this!
You're Doma?
You're a Jedi! A traitor!
You're a Jedi!?
You're a Jedi, alright.
You're a Jedi.
You're a bold one.
You're a bounty I won't forget, Cal.
You're a careful shopper, huh.
You're a coward!
You're a coward.
You're a dangerous one. 
You're a feisty one - you'll make an excellent body shield.
You're a friend, hm? Friends don't ask questions. Not friends of mine. Besides, there's much to do.
You're a goner.
You're a good girl, aren't you?
You're a good man, Cal. Better than most who frequent this bar. Though perhaps that's not saying much.
You're a good spamel.
You're a great cook. Who can blame them for wanting to learn from the best?
You're a great fighter, Cal.
You're a hard man to read, Moran.
You're a helluva hunter, Cal. Hope to see you again.
You're a killer!
You're a little short on priorite.
You're a long way from Bogano.
You're a metal frame just waiting to get taken apart. A lightsaber will make short work of your rusted parts.
You're a mite hooked on the lightning, aren't you? That's okay, just don't get carried away.
You're a monster, Bode.
You're a pain, you know that?
You're a pretty good aim - for a human.
You're a quick one!
You're a rarity these days, you know that? Wonder how much those parts of yours could fetch.
You're a real live wire, eh?
You're a real poet, B2.
You're a slippery critter, huh?
You're a slippery one!
You're a sorry sight.
You're a threat to my family.
You're a traitor to the Empire.
You're a waste of time!
You're a weakling.
You're about to finally pay for your treason.
You're afraid.
You're afraid.
You're afraid.
You're all looking at me. Why?
You're all mine now.
You're all mine now.
You're all set, BD.
You're almost done.
You're almost finished. 
You're almost there.
You're already the best, but...it never hurts to get a little practice.
You're alright!
You're alright, friend.
You're alright.
You're alright.
You're ambitious, but not devoted.
You're an ally...an ally against the Raiders. But even allies have secrets, hm? Much to do, much to do.
You're an easy mark.
You're an embarrassment.
You're annoying me.
You're around here somewhere.
You're as good as dead.
You're as good as dead. 
You're as to the point as a hyperlane, aren't you?
You're authorized. Access granted.
You're back! I confess that I didn't expect to see you so soon.
You're back! Oh, it's really good to see you!
You're back! So, what'd you find?
You're back! When the arrays failed, I feared the worst.
You're back.
You're back. Guess you're not dead.
You're barely held together.
You're better than that, right?
You're better than that.
You're bleedin' out, Cal.
You're boring me.
You're boring me.
You're boring me.
You're brave to cross us.
You're brooding.
You're certainly a tenacious one.
You're clear to move along.
You're coming with me, Jedi!
You're crowdin' me.
You're crowding me.
You're dead already.
You're dead meat, Jedi!
You're dead when I'm free!
You're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead!
You're dead.
You're dead. 
You're dead. 
You're dead. 
You're disgusting. 
You're doing great, big guy.
You're doing great, pal!
You're doing great.
You're doing great.
You're doing that now!? What if the enemy attacks?
You're done for now.
You're done for!
You're done for!
You're done for!
You're done for!
You're done for, Jedi! You can't escape this place!
You're done for.
You're done for.
You're done for.
You're done for.
You're done for.
You're done!
You're done!
You're done.
You're done. 
You're done. 
You're exhausting!
You're exhausting!
You're exposed now.
You're exposed.
You're fading.
You're fading. 
You're falling behind!
You're far more than a machine, old friend.
You're fast.
You're fast. 
You're fine.
You're finished!
You're finished!
You're finished!
You're finished!
You're finished, Jedi.
You're finished.
You're finished.
You're finished.
You're finished.
You're finished.
You're finished.
You're for it now!
You're for it, now.
You're for the scrap pile!
You're free to explore the archive.
You're friends with Greez, right?
You're frightened.
You're fun!
You're fun!
You're fun!
You're fun!
You're getting good with that blaster.
You're getting lucky.
You're giving me a stomachache.
You're giving yourself up!
You're goin' down!
You're goin' down!
You're going down!
You're going down!
You're going down!
You're going down!
You're going down!
You're going down!

You're going down.
You're going down.
You're going down. 
You're going down. 
You're going down. 
You're going down. 
You're going down. Jedi. 
You're going to be the first to die.
You're going to bleed.
You're going to die now.
You're going to die today, traitor.
You're going to die.
You're going to pay. 
You're going to regret ever crossing me, Jedi!
You're going to regret that!
You're going to regret that!
You're gonna be disappointed, but this planet ain't a culinary paradise.
You're gonna be sorry. 
You're gonna break!
You're gonna destroy me now, aren't you?
You're gonna die here.
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die... Jedi. 
You're gonna feel this one.
You're gonna feel this!
You're gonna get it now!
You're gonna hurt someone with that.
You're gonna kill him, stop!
You're gonna love it!
You're gonna love this.
You're gonna make my career, Jedi!
You're gonna mess up.
You're gonna pay for that, Jedi!
You're gonna pay now.
You're gonna regret being here. 
You're gonna regret being here. 
You're gonna regret runnin'!
You're gonna regret runnin'!
You're gonna regret that!
You're gonna regret that, Jedi!
You're gonna regret this. 
You're gonna regret this. 
You're gonna slip up.
You're gonna take the word of some religious kook? Get real.
You're good at killing droids.
You're good with that laser sword.
You're good!
You're good!
You're green, but you'll soon learn. Or you will die.
You're heading there, aren't you?
You're helpless.
You're here!
You're here, and I'll dig you out.
You're here. Splendid.
You're hiding something, mm? Yes, you are.
You're hiding?
You're how they tracked us down in the first place.
You're hurt.
You're hurt.
You're hurt.
You're hurtin' now!
You're hurtin' now!
You're hurting her!
You're in charge here, right golden top?
You're in for a treat now!
You're in for it now!
You're in for it now.
You're in for it!
You're in for it!
You're in my crosshairs!
You're in my crosshairs!
You're in my sights.
You're in the way!
You're in trouble now. 
You're in trouble!
You're injured! This'll be fast.
You're invincible!
You're just a no-good brute!
You're just a rookie.
You're just a softie, aren't you?
You're just afraid. 
You're just another job.
You're just delaying the inevitable. 
You're just dragging it out. 
You're just dragging this out.
You're just like the rest.
You're just prolonging this.
You're just scared. 
You're just stalling. 
You're just superstitious.
You're just that good, huh?
You're just trying to rattle me.
You're just weak.
You're just yanking my chain, right? Right?
You're just yanking my chain, right? Right?
You're just...a friend. Dropping by.
You're keeping up!
You're kidding me, right?
You're kidding, right? On Coruscant?
You're lacking.
You're letting him escape!
You're letting him run over you!
You're like a crook on Nar Shaddaa - always straight to business! I respect that.
You're lookin' at another 3 hours.
You're looking good as new!
You're looking grim.
You're looking hurt!
You're looking in good form!
You're looking shaky. 
You're lost.
You're lucky you don't need to stay hydrated.
You're lying!
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.
You're making me angry!
You're making moves, huh?
You're making this fun.
You're mindless instruments of pure destruction. I admire that.
You're mine Jedi!
You're mine now.
You're mine now.
You're mine to kill, Jedi.
You're mine!
You're mine!
You're mine!
You're mine!
You're mine!
You're mine!

You're mine, Jedi.
You're mine, Jedi.
You're mine, traitor!
You're mine, traitor.
You're mine, traitor. 
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine.
You're mine. 
You're mine. 
You're more cruel than some of the lowest smugglers I've ever met. That's curious.
You're more relaxed for sure.
You're never going to let me forget that, are you?
You're new here, yeah?
You're next, Jedi.
You're no joke, huh?
You're no joke, huh?
You're no marksman.
You're no match for me.
You're no match for the Brood!
You're no match for us!
You're no match!
You're no match.
You're no threat to us. I should give you the access codes.
You're no threat.
You're no warrior.
You're not a compliment.
You're not bad at all.
You're not bad, for a clanker. Let' see how you do, huh?
You're not coming?
You're not dead yet.
You're not done yet!
You're not escaping again.
You're not even worth turning!
You're not exactly sunshine and flowers, ya know?
You're not finished.
You're not free, Dagan. You're alone.
You're not getting away!
You're not getting away.
You're not getting me!
You're not getting me, Jedi.
You're not getting out of this.
You're not going to like this.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make this easy. Are you?
You're not good enough!
You're not good enough.
You're not here.
You're not leaving here.
You're not my kind of person, you know that?
You're not scary.
You're not so shy.
You're not so tough.
You're not so tough.
You're not stealthy.
You're not supposed to be here.
You're not supposed to be here.
You're not that elusive, Jedi.
You're not that good.
You're not the kind of person I want watching my back.
You're not the only one that can do that.
You're not the only one who came to Koboh for a little peace and quiet.
You're not the only one who survived.
You're not trained at all.
You're not very good at that.
You're not very good at that.
You're not very nice.
You're not walking out of here alive.
You're not worth my time, scum. It's easier to let you through.
You're not worth my time.
You're not worth my time. 
You're not worth our time.
You're nothing compared to me, Jedi.
You're nothing compared to me, Jedi.
You're nothing without that blade!
You're nothing!
You're nothing!
You're nothing, Kestis.
You're nothing.
You're nothing.
You're nothing.
You're nothing.
You're nothing. Nothing!
You're okay with me, Kestis.
You're okay, bud.
You're okay.
You're okay. Find somewhere to hide.
You're on Raider turf - and you ain't wearin' the colors.
You're on the hunt! The prowl!
You're on the run.
You're on your own for a bit.
You're only a task to me.
You're only making this worse. 
You're only making this worse. 
You're out of commission, Jedi.
You're outnumbered!
You're outta luck!
You're outwitted and outmaneuvered.
You're overreactin'.
You're overwhelmed.
You're packing some pretty fine armor there.
You're pathetic!
You're pathetic!
You're pathetic.
You're payin' for that. 
You're payin' for that. 
You're powerless to stop me!
You're practically drooling over this.
You're pretty brave, aren't you?
You're pretty fast!
You're pretty good.
You're pretty nimble!
You're pretty quick.
You're pretty quick.
You're pretty skilled.
You're pretty tall, aren't you, friend?
You're quick!
You're quick, aren't you!
You're quick. 
You're quick. Good for you. 
You're quick. I'll give you that. 
You're quick. I'll still get you. 
You're quite agile. 
You're quite fine-tuned, ain'tcha?
You're quite terrifying.
You're really gonna try this?
You're really something. 
You're rebuilding the Temple Archives.
You're right! We gotta hurry up!
You're right, Greez. I don't cook.
You're right, Greez. They were our friends and mentors. Even if they are gone, we must keep them alive.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right. All of this, it's for her.
You're right. Our friends, anyone who survived Jedha...we can't let them down.
You're right. The Mantis does deserve spoiling.
You're ruinin' my day!
You're running from a blaster, better run a little faster,
You're running? Coward!
You're rusty!
You're saying these things work using the Force?
You're scared.
You're scholars?
You're scrap!
You're scum.
You're slimier than a paddy frog, but I'd sooner have you on my side.
You're slippery. 
You're slipping.
You're slipping.
You're slipping.
You're slipping. 
You're sloppy.
You're slow.
You're so aggressive.
You're so predictable.
You're so sure you can land the shot on a Jedi?
You're something'.
You're stalling.
You're startin' to tick me off.
You're staying right here.
You're still a weakling.
You're still chained by the past.
You're still going down.
You're still gonna die.
You're still here, so I guess you must have been pretty successful.
You're still here.
You're still just Dagan's servant.
You're such a bootlicker.
You're supposed to hit me.
You're supposed to hit me.
You're swift, aren't you?
You're swift.
You're swift...
You're tellin' me, the spice levels haven't moved! Did you cook even one decent meal for yourself these last years?
You're telling me! I saw my life flash before my eyes.
You're terrified.
You're that new fella I've seen at the cantina. I'm Zygg.
You're that new fella I've seen at the cantina. I'm Zygg.
You're the best.
You're the best. 
You're the first person to figure that out.
You're the new guy, right? Sorry, I missed that. Say that again.
You're the new guy, right? Sorry, I missed that. Say that again.
You're the one taking shots at the Raiders, right?
You're the one taking shots at the Raiders, right?
You're the one who brought in Ashe and the beat droid, aren't ya?
You're the one who sent him to infiltrate my team.
You're the real deal, Kestis
You're the traveler. Have you found any systems outside the Empire's reach?
You're the voice of reason, old man. I look forward to ignoring you!
You're too close!
You're too close!
You're too close!
You're too far away!
You're too quick!
You're too scared. Just blast when you see him.
You're too skilled for droids!
You're too slow!
You're trading safety for speed!
You're trained for live fire scenarios!
You're under arrest!
You're up!
You're up!
You're up, BD.
You're up, BD.
You're up, Bode.
You're up, Cal.
You're up.
You're up.
You're upset about Armias.
You're useless.
You're using the Force.
You're very pretty.
You're wastin' both our time!
You're wastin' both our time.
You're wasting energy!
You're wasting time distrusting me, when there's who-even-knows what, right here, for the taking!
You're weak and you're tired. I'll finish you.
You're weak!
You're weak! Weak and pathetic.
You're weak, and you'll die.
You're weak, traitor. 
You're weak.
You're weak. Give up.
You're weak. You know you're weak.
You're welcome Cal.
You're welcome here anytime.
You're welcome to visit anytime.
You're welcome, boss. But what are you thanking me for? Need to borrow some credits?
You're welcome.
You're what we'd call a 'fritzin' capacitor', friend, and I don't have the parts to fix you.
You're wise to not get between me and this foe.
You're worth a lot of credits!
You're wounded.
You're wounded...
You're wounded...
You're wrong! My faith makes me strong.
You're.... you're a coward!
You're...an ally! An ally against that gang!
You're...annoying...
You're...not my enemy.
You're...probably tired, right?
You're...you're not so tough. 
You're...you're one of us! I should give you the access codes.
You've a habit for making new friends wherever you go.
You've a slimy sense for business opportunities, I'll give you that, but this one's a bust.
You've already killed for it. Maybe you're no different than the Empire after all.
You've already proven yourself. Wonder if Koboh has other holotacticians hiding, out and about?
You've avoided Cere for years. Why visit her now?
You've beaten all these chumps. Go find a new challenger!
You've been coming around here so much you're basically a regular.
You've been discovered, Jedi.
You've been here a while, huh?
You've been stopped!
You've been trespassing on my turf!
You've been?
You've changed the blasted menu again? Greez can't leave well enough alone!
You've cornered a market brimming with desperate prospectors -
You've delayed me long enough.
You've destroyed my jetpack!
You've done all you can here. Crippling the Raiders? An incredible feat.
You've earned it.
You've exposed yourself.
You've felt our wrath.
You've found enough seeds to fill this garden indefinitely.
You've gone far enough.
You've got a good eye.
You've got a good thing going, too.
You've got a keen eye for good product.
You've got both of my eyes and ears, Mosey. Honest!
You've got classified military intel stored on your yacht,
You've got dirt in your gears.
You've got great stuff.
You've got ice in your veins.
You've got it.
You've got moves!
You've got no chance.
You've got skill. 
You've got some wear and tear.
You've got this one, right BD?
You've got to check it out! Said he found it in the Wash - to think!
You've gotten yourself into a real mess, haven't you Turgle?
You've had training!
You've heard of it?
You've introduced a new species. After you plant it, I'll provide more detail.
You've learned some new tricks.
You've lost me.
You've lost me.
You've lost your spark, huh?
You've lost your way.
You've made a mistake targeting my jetpack.
You've made your last mistake. 
You've met justice.
You've no idea what I can do. You'll see.
You've no idea.
You've only met me and Cere.
You've ruined my jetpack.
You've seen all those stormtroopers around the Reach, yeah?
You've seen some action.
You've seen them before?
You've shown your hand, Jedi.
You've shown your true self, Jedi.
You've spent time in a Republic prison, right? What was that like?
You've strayed from the path.
You've sure been around the block, ain't ya?
You've travelled around a bit, right? Any words of sage advice for fightin' Jedi?
You, halt! No further!
You, however, should concern yourself more with surviving. Hah.
You, however, should concern yourself more with surviving. Hah.
You, identify yourself!
You-!
You--!
You--!
You.
You. Activate the Forest Array.
You. Approach slowly.
You. Approach slowly. 
You. Are. Mine.
You. Guard this area. And leave that body.
You. Over there. 
You. Raider killer.
You. Rayvis requested upgrades. I obliged. I need them no longer.
You. Stay right here.
You.. you shouldn't be here!
You... won't escape me!
You... you killed them all.
You... you're mine!
You...already showed me your authorization.
You...you killed her!
You? Responsible!? Please.
Young Jedi, there is another ancient site in the western desert, should you be interested.
Young sage, I have another ancient site that you may wish to visit.
Young sage, I understand you have explored desert rumors at Master Cordova's request.
Young sage, there is another site I would suggest you investigate in the southern desert.
Young sage.
Young sage.
Your Empire cannot save you now.

Your despair, it's intoxicating!
Your determination is admirable. We are sure to succeed.
Your diligence in exploring the desert's ruins leaves only one more location.

Your misplaced faith is irrelevant. You'll see.
Your move!
Your move, Kestis.

Your voice hurts my ears.
Your weapon doesn't concern me.
Your weapon doesn't concern me.
Your words are empty, only action matters!
Your work is noble and just.
Your zeal is admirable. Even if you do not survive, such passion will aid our victory.
Your zeal is commendable, but don't overextend yourself fighting the enemy.
Yours for the taking now...
Yours is an unorthodox strategy. I hope it works.
Yughhhh
Yup!
Yup, I'm coming.
Yup, and this one's a whopper. It can snap your arms off like puerco sticks.
Yup, but the product is only part of the sale. You're also buying what's behind it.
Yup, but you're going first!
Yup, you get it.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup. Save me a seat!
Yup. You corner something, it'll do what it needs to survive.
Z-95s?
Z-N0 begs the crew to allow him to join their quest.
Z-N0, Greez, and Bode stand around the ship's holomap.  Greez reports that the Mantis ready to fly again.
Zap 'em!
Zap that one!
Zee introduces herself, presents her High Republic tuner, and turns to Cal. She offers it up like a miniature Excalibur.
Zee is lucky to have a friend like you.
Zee seems to be back on her feet.
Zee stays at the cantina where the bartender Monk catches her up on how the galaxy has changed.
Zee!
Zee! You made it!
Zee's close.
Zee's helping us out...
Zee's in there somewhere. Hope she's alright.
Zee, I still can't believe you were down in the basement. For two hundred years...
Zee, got any advice on confronting Dagan?
Zee, looks like you've got a loose cable. Power down real quick, and I'll fix it.
Zee, none of this would've been possible without you. You sure you don't want to come to Tanalorr?
Zee, that planet you mentioned. What's it like?
Zee, what's going on?
Zee, you did everything she asked. You kept the dream of Tanalorr alive.
Zee.
Zee.
Zee.
Zee.
Zee?
Zee?
Zero.
Zygg here thinks we should leave Koboh, but I'm not so sure.
Zygg's right, Cal. I spent most of my life ensnared by opulence.
Zygg, where's the best place to catch a sunset on Koboh?
Zygg, you're handy with the wrench, as they say.
